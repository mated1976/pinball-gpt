The right ramp will award the skill shot even if the ball only goes half way up.  Hitting any other shot, or the slings, will fail the skillshot.\nROOM TRAVELAt the beginning of the game, and after any monster battle, you start out at the entrance to the castle, in the lowest room of the grid.While at the entrance you can select the monster you want to battle by shooting the center 3 target. This will cycle through the available monsters.Shooting the left or right orbit when strobing will move up+left or up+right, respectively.  If there is no room in that direction on the grid, the orbit will not be lit.As soon as you shoot one of the outside orbits you lock in your monster and get into the first room.In the beginning, you will move directly to the Laboratory/Dungeon, one step away from the monster.  After defeating 3 monsters, you will only move to the Conservatory/Ballroom (two steps away), and then after another monster you will have to move through all rooms individually.Rooms are laid out as follows:\nMONSTER BATTLESThere are four ways to start a monster battle:\nReach the topmost room in the grid via the orbits.\nShoot the secret passage (to the right of the left ramp) when lit.  Shoot the center 3 targets three times once a monster has been selected to light the secret passage.  Can also be lit via skillshot or mystery.\nAs a mystery award.  Early mystery awards have a high tendency of immediately starting the battle, even if a monster isn\u2019t locked in.\nAs a pity award on the last ball.  If a player doesn\u2019t reach a monster at some point in their game; launching the 3rd ball will put you in the monster room that was currently selected (even if it has not been locked in)\nMYSTERY AWARDSShoot the middle scoop (left of 3 center targets) to build mystery. When the award is ready the left scoop arrow will do a color cycle animation to indicate its ready to collect. This will commonly award monster progress, such as \u201cmove 1 room\u201d, \u201cmove 2 rooms\u201d, or \u201cadvance to monster\u201d, and sometimes point values. (are there other awards?)  If not collected, the mystery will eventually time out and need to be lit again.\nCRYPT MBLock a ball in the crypt (to the left of right ramp), by either shooting into it from the lower playfield, or by dropping into it via the rightmost of the three upper lanes.  Once a ball is locked, the crypt shot will light blue(?), and shooting it again (via either playfield) will start Crypt Multiball.\nDuring Crypt MB, shoot the crypt for jackpots.  This multiball can be stacked with any monster battle (including Frank MB); you can make progress through the rooms while in multiball, or start it while already in a battle.\nAfter you exit multiball, repeated shots (how many?) into the crypt from the lower playfield (upper does not give credit?) will reactivate the lock (note there is no indication that the lock is ready besides that the back drop target will be up).\nFRANK MBShoot left left via left ramp into physical lock. Then get to upper playfield and knock down the drop target and shoot the upper left ramp behind it to start multiball. This mode will block the start of any other monster, and can be started as many times as you are able to.\nDuring Frank MB, shoot either lower ramp for jackpot.  After three jackpots, the upper right ramp (guillotine) will light for supers.  (does it ever unlight?)\nUPPER LANESComplete the two \u2018X\u2019 lanes to activate light the lower right target (above right inlane/outlane) for a bonus multiplier.  Use flippers for lane change.\nCOMBOSShooting some shots (which?) will temporarily flash other shots orange for a combo.\nEXTRA BALLExtra ball can be lit by shooting the upper right ramp 10 times (\u2018chops\u2019 displayed on display).Will also be lit after starting third monster battle (including frank)\nExtra ball will light at the extra ball target on the left side of the upper playfield.\nBALL SAVESBall save is activated when you complete the 4 bottom lanes.  The outlanes will then light purple for 45 seconds.  Draining on the outside lane when lit activates the drain magnet and will fling the ball back up the playfield, or at least is should. This mod is being coined Mag-Neat-O save.  If you complete the fourth lane as you drain, the ball save will activate and be immediately used.  During multiball the magnet is not active, and another ball will be auto-plunged instead.\nITEMSThere are two items for each monster, located as follows:\nBallroom, Alice: JacketBallroom, Insect: ZapperParlor, Vampire: Pool CueParlor, Wolf: ShotgunDungeon, Zombie: ChainsawDungeon, Igor: WhipConservatory, Pit Creature & Alice: ShearsConservatory, Wolf: WolfsbaneKitchen, PitCreature: SaltKitchen, Vampire: GarlicLabratory, Ethyl: FormaldehydeLabratory, Zombie: DynamiteLibrary, Ethyl: CrossLibrary, Igor & Insect: Book\nWhen you are in the listed room, with the specified monster selected, the target at the back of the upper playfield will flash.  Shooting it will collect the item.  See the specific monster for item effects\nNote that, since at the beginning of the game, you always move directly to the lab/dungeon, you can only collect items in those rooms, so only certain monsters will give you access to items until some monsters are defeated\nMONSTER BATTLESAt the beginning of each battle, the ball save will activate.  Complete the mode\u2019s objective to start a 25(?) second \u2018frenzy\u2019 with unlimited ball save.  The frenzy will have the mode shots active which score big points as well as other arrow shots lit orange to also collect points and add to the hurry-up.\nAfter the frenzy ends, the left target (above mystery scoop) will light for a hurry-up.  the hurry-up starting value is ALL the points scored during the frenzy phase of that monster battle, with a minimum base value of 5M * (# monsters defeated, including this one). The hurry-up counts down to 2.5M * monsters.  It counts down fast, so you have to be quick!\nThere is no maximum to the hurry-up starting value.  Once the hurry up times out, you will back to single ball play ready to battle the next monster.\nFRANKSee FRANK MB\nETHYLFrom the upper playfield drop ball into the crypt via the rightmost lane. Another ball bill be auto-launched. Shoot first lower drop target or the rightmost lane again to release, then keep shooting the drop targets/scoop to collect jackpots.  Mode ends when you drain one of the balls.  (how to win?)\nItem: Skip straight to super jackpot stage\nIGORComplete three sets of lit shots.  First set will be three shots, then four, then five(?)\nItem: skip straight to third set of shots\nVAMPIREStake/dismember the vampire by hitting the back target on the upper playfield three times.\nItem: Only one shot to back target is required\nALICEGet to upper playfield and shoot past guillotine 2 times. The guillotine lowers a bit. Shoot a 3rd time to capture the ball in the guillotine. Theatrics play and Alices head gets chopped off.\nItem: Only one shot to the guillotine is required\nWOLFShoot any green shot to load the gun, then shoot the three bank to fire the gun and damage the monster.  Shots will light green again, but the ones you\u2019ve already shot will be red instead.  Shooting a red shot will damage the player.  Health bars are shown on the screen.  Defeat the wolf before it defeats you (usually 5 hits?).\nItem: only one shot is needed to kill the wolf\nZOMBIEOne roaming shot will move back and forth across the playfield on the orbits, ramps, center scoop, and inner orbit (secret passage).  Value will decrease on a timer until the shot is made.  Complete 5 shots to finish the mode.\nItem: only one shot is needed to kill the zombie\nINSECTRandom shots and targets will be lit.  Shoot 10 to complete mode.\nItem: only five shots are needed to complete the mode\nPITCREATUREThe mystery scoop, center scoop, and crypt will flash.  Behind one (random?) is the pit creature.  Once found, most shots will light, and a count down timer will start.  The timer will only count down while the ball is \u2018hidden\u2019 from view, such as being in a scoop/subway, or going through one of the orbits under the upper playfield.  Count the timer down to zero to finish the mode.\nItem: first shot will always find the creature\nBILLION DOLLAR BABYWizard mode, available after completing all other modes.how to start?how to play?\nHas anyone had any time on this game yet? I started playing one on location yesterday and had a bunch of confusing moments, but wasn\u2019t sure if they were due to incomplete code or mechanical issues. I\u2019ve only had about 5 games on it, so these are very early impressions and are relatively uninformed.\nWhen the mode is ready, it says to start it at the secret passage. The passage shot is lit, but when shooting it, the ball just comes around the right orbit without starting a mode. After a drain, launching the next ball will start the lit mode though.\nShooting the center scoop builds the mystery, but when mystery is lit on the left scoop it doesnt award anything, just stays lit.\nWhen you use the outlane ball save (earned and used just like TNA), there is a magnet below the flippers that grabs the ball. I thought it was going to toss the ball back into play like 007, but it just dropped it and another ball autolaunched into play. Is this the intended behavior?\nThe ramps are STEEP. This is a brand new game and the shot needs to be damn near perfect for the left ramp (which will usually roll back sdtm) and absolutely perfect and preferably with a moving ball to make the right ramp. Maybe flipper strength can be adjusted in settings, but as it stands they\u2019re super difficult and frustrating.\nA plea to Spooky - PLEASE give some warning on the left scoop kickout. A light, a sound effect,something! There are two hidden scoops in the middle of the playfield that feed the left kickout and it\u2019s very unclear where the ball is coming from.\nI ended up in multiball once over 5 games because the ramps were so hard to hit. And the goal when the multiball started was\u2026 shoot the ramps! Good grief. Well with the traffic of multiball it was even tougher to hit the already difficult ramps. Again, this could come down to a flipper strength setting.\nShots that exit the right orbit are almost always catching the right sling. Is this intended, or possibly a pitch issue? Maybe the game is set too steep, I don\u2019t know. Could explain the ramp difficulty though.\nThat\u2019s all I can think of for now, but I\u2019ll add more as I get more time on it. The art and display are nicely done. Couldn\u2019t really hear the audio because of the noisy room. Upper playfield is unique and gives some good nudging opportunities, but I didn\u2019t make it up there enough to really get a feel for it.\nExcellent presentation at TPF,@bkerins. I like your concept of the mode score multiplier. Interesting \u2018take now or save for later\u2019 debate to have with one self. Great innovation. The victory lap hurry up too.\nAnd I especially liked to see, that the GI light effects seem to have been toned way down compared to what I remember from previous ACNC footage. At least in the lower 1/3 which is what matters the most. Others could learn from this.\n@bkerinsIs there a stream archive of your ACNC tutorial seminar at TPF?  I noticed that Marty has a stream on his Twitch channel with you playing the next day that likely has some similar explanations. But I figured I\u2019d try to watch the one where you had a few more hours of sleep.\nHa yeah. The other one is better explained and it\u2019s on twitch.\nhttps://twitch.tv/videos/400129332\n\u2026 and, it\u2019s gone! I\u2019ll ask them about when they plan to upload to YouTube.\nWe got to play this last night in league. I had a great time of the game. We ran into a lot of problems using this as a competition game. It is possible we were not on the lastest code, as I know some of the collectors other games were on older code. So hopefully things are already addressed.\nBiggest was tilt-throughs. The game had been set super tight. If someone did a hard move, they often tilted through 2-4 players. Tilting through on a modern game is annoying. Tilting through multiple players on a modern game should not happen.\nSecond was crashes. Some seemed to be related to tilting (like tilt into lock) others were just at unfortunate times, like offer entering initials.\nThe game was super fun. I really want to spend more time on it. Hopefully it will get competition ready because the strategy and risk /reward is great.\nAlong with that, is there any reason why the SAVE expires? It seems counter intuitive to hold your SAVE lanes at 3 until you want to activate the ball save. Also, your SAVE gets used while ball save is active, which is a minor modern inconvenience.\nSecond was crashes.\nOn what I assume is current code, I had a Danessi softlock where the ball would not eject itself from the 2nd drop target of the lock when stuck.\nDefinitely gives a TNA 2.0 vibe, which is pretty darn cool. Its solid work!\nMYSTERY AWARDSShoot the middle scoop (left of 3 center targets) to build mystery. When the award is ready the left scoop arrow will do a color cycle animation to indicate its ready to collect\nI noticed one of the awards that comes up on the list is tilt other player. Never got that award but I like the idea.\nWas noted on pinside that this rulesheet is out of date, but it seems I can\u2019t edit it to fix it up?\nDoesn\u2019t look like anyone has turned it into a wiki. One of the mods can do it.\nRulesheet has been Wikified.\nUpdated with my partial knowledge of the latest code (1.07)\nExtra ball is also lit when you start your 3rd mode (Frank MB counts as a mode).\nSo does hitting the end of mode Hurry Ups increase the base scoring on forthcoming modes? What incentives and perks are these Hurry ups giving apart from points, if any?\nAnd how did I light the Special on the right loop? Mystery?..x amount of Combos?? This pin is nuts\u2026 I love it!!\nMork calling Orsen\u2026 Come in, Orsen\u2026\nimpressive stuff by@kdeangelo, once again plowing through Wizard mode!\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/555878408?t=00h45m24s\nDoes anybody know how the weapons work in the new code?\nUpdated with item rules\nSo if you collect either of the two items for a Monster, then you get the listed benefit for the Monster\u2019s item?"

        "https://rules.silverballmania.com/rules/G4d9B-MJk65": "Cosmic Princess SS - Allied Leisure | 1979\nQuickie Version:\nUp top until you have the #3 lane at a minimum, then drop targets until you have 5X bonus, then spinners all day.\nGo-to Flipper:\nBalanced\nRisk Index:\nMedium-High\nSkillshot(s):\nMake the #3 lane, which adds 1K to the value of one of the spinners; which one alternates on switch hits. The other lanes each add 400 to the value of one spinner or the other, like the top stand-up targets on Trident. The green #1 and amber #2 add to the left spinner; orange #4 and red #5 to the right spinner. Four of the top lanes can be gotten other ways: the 2 via the standup target below the left spinner, the 4 via the standup below the right spinner, and the 1 and 5 via the left orbit shot to the top. The 3 you must score directly, hence its higher value. Don\u2019t bother shooting at the two standups, though, just go up top.\nFull Rules:\nSimilar in many ways to Trident and Magic by Stern, but more fun to play than either, Cosmic Princess is rare to see in the US. If you come across one, don\u2019t pass up a chance to play it! It\u2019s a bonus-and-spinner game with an appealing playfield layout that really rewards skill. Once you\u2019ve made all five lanes, the spinner with the pink light on to match #3 is worth 2K per spin, the other 1K. Base bonus is earned by collecting top lanes, return lanes (3 advances each) and outlanes (also 3 advances) and goes up to 19K. Bonus multiplier is built up by completing the drop targets the same way as on Trident: hit the 2nd and 4th targets for 2X + 5K; 1\\3\\5 for 3X + 10K; 1\\2\\4\\5 gives 4X + 20K; all 5 gives 5x + 30K. Maximum collectable bonus is thus 95K. Both base bonus and multiplier reset each ball. There are so many ways to advance base bonus that any decent-length ball will max out unless you collect bonus first, making getting the drop targets for bonus X imperative. The collect bonus saucer at the upper left is always active. When collect is scored, the base bonus resets but any multiplier is held for the rest of that ball. You can\u2019t shoot at the saucer directly, but balls bouncing around the top two bumpers often go into it, so when you want to collect, send the ball there via the right spinner. Since it\u2019s easy to rebuild bonus, once you have it at maximum with a decent multiplier, collecting it should be your top priority. The outer return lanes score 2K minimum, but go up 2K in value each time you make the left orbit shot up top until worth an additional 6K each. After you have your 5X active, just shoot spinners all day: left for spinner points and to the top to build bonus, right for a chance to collect it.\nPinVideosMatch Play*youtubeOPDBIPDBFlyer*\nCosmic Princess SS - Allied Leisure | 1979\nPlayers: 4\nDisplay: alphanumeric",
        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/cosmicprincess_G4d9B.html": "Not to be confused with Cosmic Gunfight (Williams, 1982).\nTry to make the #3 top lane on the opening plunge. If your game is set so that specials score 100,000 points, go only for completions of the drop targets. Otherwise, split your focus between the drop targets for bonus multipliers and the spinners; the left spinner/orbit takes you back to the top to collect more numbers and increase the spinner values, while the right spinner gives you a chance at a full bonus collect.\nNumbered 1 to 5. Going through any lane scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance, and lights that number. Lighting numbers is how you increase the value of the spinners, discussed in more detail later. The 2 and 4 can be collected from standup targets in the lower corners of the playfield, and the 1 and 5 can be collected from the left orbit rollovers, so getting the 3 as soon as possible (ideally off the plunge) is preferred. Completing 1-5 once lights the near left in lane for an extra ball and resets the 1-5 lights (though the spinners keep their value). Completing 1-5 twice in a single ball scores a special.\nThe uppermost bumper always scores 1,000 points and a bonus advance. The other two bumpers score 1,000 points in a 3-ball game or 100 in a 5-ball game, and do not advance bonus.\nAny target down scores 500 points.For the first set, only the second and fourth targets will be up. Clearing both scores 5,000 points and 2x bonus.For the second set, only the first, third, and fifth targets are up. Clear all 3 for 10,000 points, 3x bonus, and the near right in lane being lit for Special.For the third set, all targets except the middle will be up. Clear all 4 for 20,000 points and 4x bonus.For the fourth set, all 5 targets must be cleared. Do so for 30,000 points and 5x bonus.Any completions after the 4th on a single ball require hitting all 5 targets and score an instant special.\nThe saucer cannot be shot directly, but the ball frequently ends up there off the pop bumpers from a right spinner shot. This saucer scores a full collect of the entire bonus with multiplier. After the collect, the base bonus will be reset to 1,000, but any collected multipliers remain intact.\nThe spinners score 200 points per spin by default. Each of the 1 and 2 add 400 points per spin to the left spinner's value if they have been collected this ball; the 4 and 5 do the same to the right spinner value. Collecting the 3 lights one of the spinners pink, alternating on pop bumper and 10-point switch hits; the lit pink spinner is worth an extra 1,000 per spin. Thus, after all 5 numbers have been collected once on a ball, there will always be one spinner worth 1,000 per spin, and the other worth 2,000 per spin. If specials are not set to be worth points, a 2,000 point spinner is the best value shot in the game.\nBehind the left spinner are three star rollovers. Two of these spot the numbers 1 and 5, while the star in the middle increases the point value of the far in lanes, discussed in more detail in the Bottom of the table section.\nThe one on the left spots #2, and the one on the right spots #4. Both score 1,000 points and a bonus advance.\nCosmic Princess has a nearly conventional in/out lane setup, with a second set of in lanes closer to the flippers in place of a standard slingshot.Out lanes always score 5,000 points and 3 bonus advance.The far in lanes start out scoring 2,000 points. The star rollover directly above the flippers and the middle star rollover in the left orbit advance these lanes, adding 2,000 to their value, up to a maximum of 8,000 points.The left near in lane scores 5,000 points and 3 bonus advance, and is lit for extra ball after completing the set of 1-2-3-4-5. The right near in lane scores 5,000 points and can be lit for a Special by achieving 3x bonus.\nBase bonus is advanced by any top lane, any standup target, the Spot 1 and Spot 5 rollovers in the left orbit, and the uppermost pop bumper. Base bonus is advanced 3 times by the out lanes or the near in lanes. Max base bonus is 19,000 points. Bonus multiplier is advanced one step with each completion of the drop target bank, up to a maximum of 5x. Max bonus, then, is 5x 19,000 = 95,000 points. Neither base bonus nor bonus multiplier can ever be carried from ball to ball. The upper right saucer is always available as a mid-ball bonus collect; this is a full collect including the multiplier, and after the collect, your base bonus will be reset to 1,000 but all multipliers stay intact.\nIn competition/novelty play, specials score 100,000 points. If this setting is on and specials are open ended (see below), it may be worthwhile to ignore the spinners and continue clearing drop targets to collect 100,000s. There is no setting that allows setting a point value to extra balls.\nThe drop target special and the in lane special can each individually be set to a limit of 1 per ball or \"open ended\" (infinite available).\nThe extra ball and special on the in lanes can be set to alternate on pop bumper hits instead of always being on once lit."

Sequence matters. You need the single white target to advance to double bonus; the two yellow targets plus the white one gives you triple; white, yellows and the three purple targets gives 4X; and adding the four red drops makes it 5X. But if you have nine of the ten drops and the one you\u2019re missing is the white one \u2026 you\u2019re still at single bonus. The order you actually hit them in doesn\u2019t matter, just which ones you\u2019ve got so far. If you get the white one last but do get it before you drain, you\u2019ll still get your 5X. But you want to get them in order in case you drain before you get them all. Each completed target color set also lights the corresponding top lane for the higher value - - the white lane on the right goes from 100 to 1000, the yellow lane from 500 to 5K, purple from 1000 to Extra Ball, red one from 5000 to special [useless in competition]. If extra balls are enabled, one strategy is to shoot for the purple targets first, then flip the ball up top and try to get it to drop through the purple lane to score the extra ball. Center spinner advances bonus 1K for every 5 spins. Green star rollovers on the upper left advance bonus 1K each when lit; top lanes light them, one for each. Go up top to advance your base bonus and get the drop targets to multiply it. Once you finish the drop targets, the bonus will be collected, and you can rebuild it and collect it again. You\u2019ll need to redo both the base and the multiplier. The bonus counting down can be distracting if you\u2019re not expecting it; the best thing to do is go back up top while it counts.

        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/sinbad_G4xqN.html": "Sinbad has both 4-player solid state and 4-player electromechanical versions. Eye of the Tiger is a 2-player electromechanical version. This guide was written with the solid state version in mind. Differences in the electromechanical versions are discussed at the end of the guide.\nHit drop targets! Bonus X depends on completing banks of drop targets in order, so make sure you hit the whites and yellows. Don't scissor drain.\nAll drop targets are worth 3,000 points and advance the bonus.\nThe white target lites the left standup target, the standup near the bumpers, and the rightmost top lane for 1,000 points each, as well as lighting 2X bonus.\nCompleting the yellow targets lights the lower right side lane, the out lanes, and the third top lane from the left for 5,000 points each (they are normally worth 500). It also lights 3X bonus,but only if the white target has also been knocked down.\nCompleting the purple targets lights the second top lane from the left for extra ball, in addition to its usual 1,000 points. It also lights 4X bonus,but only if the white target AND both yellow targets are down.\nCompleting the red targets lights the leftmost top lane for special in addition to its usual 5,000 points. It also lights 5X bonus,but only if all of the white, yellow, and purple targets are all down.\nIf, for example, you complete the yellow targets before the white, but then go back and knock down the white, you will jump straight from 1X bonus to 3X. This works for jumping straight to 4X or 5X as well if you complete the purple or red before completing every target below them.\nWhen all targets are knocked down, they will all reset, with their value increased from 3,000 each to 5,000. The bonus will also automatically count down and drain, allowing the player to build it up again with more targets. (It is possible for the base bonus to exceed 10,000, since the spinner can also advance bonus.) It is not possible for the bonus X to exceed 5X, but the targets can reset again with another mid-ball bonus cash-in if all targets are knocked down a second time. That last bit is pretty much impossible.\nFor simplicity, I will refer to the lanes as 1, 2, 3, and 4, from left to right.Lane 1 is always worth 5,000, with a Special thrown in if it is lit by completing the red drop targets.Lane 2 is always worth 1,000, with an extra ball thrown in if it is lit by completing the purple targets.Lane 3 is worth 500 when unlit, or 5,000 when lit, and is lit by completing the yellow targets.Lane 4 is worth 100 when unlit, or 1,000 when lit, and is lit by hitting the white target.\nOn the plunge, the only ways to be sure to avoid a house ball are to go in lane 4 and take the measly 100 points, or avoid the top lanes entirely and come down the left side for a feed to one of the right flippers.\nThe only reliable way to get back to the top lanes is through the left side lane, but this is a very difficult shot. It might be better to just shoot up the spinner or next to the red targets, hope for good pop bumper luck, and nudge to get the lane you want, if ever you want to get a prize from the top lanes.\nThe spinner, lodged between the yellow and purple targets, advances the bonus every 5th spin. It's not a bad thing if you hit it, but going for any drop targets that are left is pretty much always preferred. Be careful about immediate returns through the spinner off a bumper if a shot hits the spinner.\nThere are double flippers on both sides of the playfield, and no in lanes. It is possible to scissor drain between the flippers on both sides. Be very careful about holding the flipper up for too long when the ball is near the inner flippers. Trapping up on the outer flippers is possible, though, and can even be a good idea to more safely hit the white, purple, or red targets.\nOn Sinbad EM and Eye of the Tiger, the only bonus multiplier is 2x. This is award by completing the white, yellow, and purple drop targets. Those targets score 500 points each; only the red drop targets score 3,000 points each.\nThe bonus is not automatically collected if you knock down every drop target in the game, and drop targets never reset mid-ball.\nOnly some of the yellow features are lit at a time. Pop bumpers alternate whether the left out lane and yellow top lane are lit, or the right side lane and right out lane are lit.\nThe game has 5 score reels and a 100,000 light rather than a full 6 digit display."

Starts \"lit\".",
        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/farfalla_GRVw2.html": "Hit drop targets, they advance bonus. Completing red, yellow, and blue multiple times lights the Multispecial for 1,000,000 points. Completing the orange multiple times lights the orange special for 300,000 points or an extra ball. Bonus maxes at 20,000 and can be collected under the ramp. Bonus multiplier is supposed to be collected from top lanes, but more realistically you'll get it from lit in lanes.\nOn the plunge, the ball will go through L, O, or V. The E lane actually takes the ball back up top for another trip down L, O, or V. Completing L-O-V-E advances the bonus multipler, to 5X, 10X, or 20X. Letters in L-O-V-E can also be spotted from lit in lanes- which is the only realistic way to get these letters, since the lanes are in no man's land and can't be shot for directly.\nTwo are lit, and two are not. Lit bumpers score 1,000 points, and every 5 hits to lit pop bumpers scores a bonus advance. Unlit bumpers score 100 points. A hidden switch in the horizontal rubber wall to the right of the red drop targets alternates which bumpers are lit.\nIn the back left of the game. Each target down scores 800 points and a bonus advance. Completing the bank advances the progress toward the Red portion of the Multispecial and increases the value of each target in the bank for future completions up to 1,000 -> 3,000 -> 5,000 -> 8,000 per target.\nFunction identically to the red drop targets, with one addendum: behind the blue drop targets is a Move Ramp target, which lowers the ramp if the Special Bonus is not lit.\nSimilar to the red and blue targets: each target down is worth 800 the first time, 1,000 the second time, 3,000 the third time, and 5,000 the fourth. Completions of this bank do not work toward the Multispecial though, since this bank has its own Orange Special. The orange special is lit after 3 completions of the orange targets, at which point completing the bank again scores either 300,000 points or an extra ball and unlights the orange targets completely.\nThe ramp starts in the up position, revealing the Special Bonus lane. The Special Bonus lane scores 10,000 points when not lit. If the base bonus is maxed out at 20,000 points, Special Bonus is lit; going through the Special Bonus lane scores the entire current bonus with multiplier and resets both the base bonus count and the multiplier. Collecting a lit Special bonus also spots a completion of whatever colour target bank has the least progress toward Multispecial.\nWhen Special Bonus is not lit, hitting either Move Ramp target- on the left side of the playfield, or behind the blue targets- lowers the ramp, blocking off the Special Bonus lane. Going up the ramp to the upper playfield raises the ramp. Lighting Special Bonus when the ramp is down does not immediately raise the ramp, but the ramp cannot be lowered if Special Bonus is lit.\nEach yellow target on the upper playfield scores 30,000 points. Any completion of the bank, even across multiple trips to the upper playfield, advances the yellow lights toward Multispecial. Completing the entire bank of 6 targets in a single trip lights the upper special at the standup in the top left of the upper playfield, which scores 150,000 points or an extra ball.\nCompleting the red, yellow, and blue targets the requisite number of times- could be 1, 2, or 4- lights the standup target to the right of the ramp for Multispecial, which can be set to a replay, an extra ball, or 1,000,000 points. Scores 5,000 points when not lit.\nThe in lanes and out lanes are in their usual order, but notice that part of the in/out lane dividing rail is a literal entire flipper. When an out lane is lit, React! is ready, meaning you get one chance at a well timed flip on that side where the flipper will flip outwards and fling the ball back up the out lane. Doing this unlights said out lane. Both out lanes can be relit by completing any bank of drop targets.The in lanes spot letters in L-O-V-E when lit. Only one will be lit at a time, and slingshots switch them.Bonus and bonus multiplierCompleting L-O-V-E advances bonus multiplier to 5X, 10X, or 20X. Bonus multiplier is not carried from ball to ball. Any drop target, plus every 5 hits to a lit bumper, advances base bonus count up to a maximum of 20. Base bonus can be carried from ball to ball. Max bonus is 20x 20,000 = 400,000 points. The full bonus including multiplier can be collected, but is reset, at the lit Special Bonus lane.Game Time BonusOn ball 3, the high score display will show a value that starts at 10. Every 3 switch hits on ball 3 increases this count by 1. This is the Game Time Bonus. After ball 3 drains, a special timed ball 4 will be given; the displayed count equals the number of half-seconds that ball 4 will be available. If an extra ball is earned during the Game Time Bonus, the clock will stop until the current ball in play drains. If an extra ball is earned on ball 3, the timer cannot be built further until all extra balls have been used.Settings and miscellaneaMultispecial can score 1,000,000 points, a free game, an extra ball, or \"Super Bonus\".

        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/fishtales_G5Wxd.html": "Focus on multiballs: shoot the Caster's Club on the right to lock balls, and lock 3 balls for multiball. During multiball, relock a ball (or two, for a double jackpot) then shoot the spinner to collect; after 3 jackpots, the captive ball has unlimited super jackpots for the rest of multiball. Other strategies: make 6 shots to the lit center ramp for the big value Monster Fish, or shoot the right orbit when lit (by the left in lane or a previous right orbit shot) to advance the captive ball award.\nShooting the right orbit when it is not lit will send the ball to the top lanes and light the orbit. When the right orbit is lit, making it will send the ball all the way around the back and down the left orbit, scoring a million-plus Long Cast (starts at 1,000,000, caps at 5,000,000) and qualifying the next captive ball.\nThe captive ball has 5 awards. Lit awards have been collected, and flashing awards have been qualified. More than one can be flashing at once, but only one can be collected per hit. The awards are:\n1,000,000 points and hold bonus (both base bonus and multiplier)\n2,000,000 points and light video mode (at the back saucer, shootable from a left orbit shot)\n3,000,000 points and start Rock the Boat\n5,000,000 points and lights extra ball\n10,000,000 points and instant multiball\nIf no awards are flashing, the captive ball awards:\n500,000 points if no awards have been collected\nthe \"Grab Yer Gear\" bonus of 1,000,000 per lit award, if between 1 and 4 awards have been collected\nthe \"Sell Yer Gear\" bonus, which starts at 5,000,000 and increases by 500,000 with each subsequent hit up to a maximum of 10,000,000, for the rest of the ball after collecting the Instant Multiball\nShoot whichever center ramp is lit to light one of the 6 hooked fish just beneath the center ramp entrance. The ball must go all the way up the side to count: if it chokes up and falls down the other side, a 1,000,000 point U-Turn is scored, by a fish is not lit. Successful ramp shots score 500,000 the first time, increasing by 500,000 each time, until the 6th is worth 3,000,000. At the start of the ball, both side of the ramp are lit. After one made shot, only one side will typically be lit at a time, and it can time out. If neither side is lit, going through an in lane will light the opposite center ramp, which can be easily achieved by making an unlit ramp.After collecting the 3,000,000 ramp, the spinner in the left orbit will be lit for Monster Fish. This is a hurry-up award that starts at 20,000,000 points, counts down to 5,000,000 over about 15 seconds, and times out a bout 5 seconds after reaching 5,000,000. Hit the spinner even a single time to collect. If the Monster Fish was successfully collected, the next Monster Fish will be worth 10,000,000 more points: the Monster Fish max value caps at 50,000,000 after three or more previous successful collects.\nGoing through a lit right in lane temporarily enables the Fish Finder at the left orbit. (If the right in lane is not lit, completing the L-I-E top lanes will light it.) The Fish Finder is a mystery award available at the saucer in the very back right of the game, shootable only from a strong left orbit shot. Possible Fish Finder mystery awards are the following:\nlight extra ball\nsuper jets - pop bumpers score 500,000 points for the rest of the ball\ninstant multiball\nincrease captive ball (lights the next unlit value)\nincrease bonus x\npoints (typically around 4 million)\nThe mystery does not give awards that are useless to you- it will not give increase bonus X if you are maxed at 7X, it will not give super jets if that is already running, and it will not increase the captive ball if all 5 awards are flashing or collected.\nThe second captive ball award is video mode, which is also available at the back saucer where Fish Finder is collected. During video mode, the goal is to hit the button on the \"plunger\" to shoot torpedoes (!) such that they hit the waterskiers driving by. You have 20 seconds and a supply of 20 torpedoes, and 20 waterskiers will drive by in total, at three distances away from your point of view. Hitting a waterskier in the front row scores 500,000 points; the middle row, 1,000,000 points; and the far row, 1,500,000 points. After hitting enough back row skiers (usually between 3 and 5), the next back row waterskier will be replaced with either the letters EB (for extra ball) or BS (for big score, which is worth 20,000,000, and only appears if extra balls are off). Hit at least 15 of the 20 skiers for a 10,000,000 accuracy bonus; go a perfect 20 for 20 and that becomes a 20,000,000 flawless bonus. A single video mode can be worth 40-60 million depending on whether or not the Big Score is available.\nThere are two standup targets in the lower left, and two more in the lower right. Hitting either target in a bank lights one of the three segments of the fish closest to it. Light an entire fish to score a Stringer, which is one of the large fish across the center of the playfield. Scoring a fish lights the spinner in the left orbit for Stretch the Truth for 15 seconds: shoot the spinner to tell a lie about how big the fish was. The spinner will rotate how believeable the lie was and how many points the lie scores: possible scores are 500,000, 1,000,000, 2,000,000, 3,000,000, or 5,000,000. However, each completion of L-I-E on the current ball will unlight the lowest lit value, making it ineligible to be selected! This makes it easier to score a couple million points per completed fish, anyway.\nLighting all 4 Stringer fish starts Feed Frenzy. The goal in this mode is to shoot shots with lit purple fish (both orbits and both center ramp shots). You have 15 seconds to shoot a purple fish shot. Doing so scores 5,000,000 points, unlights that purple fish, and resets the clock to 15 seconds. The fourth purple fish is worth 20,000,000 and ends the mode.\nA timed mode that lasts for 20 seconds (if gotten as the third captive ball award) or 30 seconds (if gotten for telling 4 tales). During Rock the Boat, all boat shots- including both ramps, a U-Turn, and the captive ball- are woth 10,000,000 points. This is fantastic value, especially if a multiball is running, so take advantage of it accordingly.\nShoot the Caster's Club just to the left of the right orbit to lock a ball. (If multiball has already been played and a jackpot has already been collected in the game so far by the current player, the first shot to Caster's Club will knock down a drop target in front of it, which then lights the locks.) If the Caster's Club is shotimmediatelyafter a plunge or a right orbit Long Cast shot, a Fast Cast will be scored, which is worth 2,000,000 the first time, and an additional 1,000,000 each subsequent time, to a max of 10,000,000. Locking three balls in the Caster's Club, or collecting the multiball award from the 5th captive ball or the Fish Finder, starts multiball.\nThe goal during multiball is to collect jackpots. Jackpot is lit for 15 seconds after re-locking one ball in the Caster's Club. To collect the jackpot, shoot the left orbit; the jackpot is at the Fish Finder saucer. After collecting a jackpot, the relocked ball will be spit out, and yet another ball must be put into Caster's Club for the next jackpot. The first jackpot is the Tropical jackpot, worth 20,000,000 points; the second is the Fresh Water jackpot, worth 30,000,000; the third is the Deep Sea jackpot, worth 40,000,000. Any relocked balls will be automatically kicked out if a jackpot is not scored within 15 seconds of the relock. After all three tackle box jackpots have been collected, the captive ball will be lit for a 100,000,000 point Super Jackpot, which can be collected repeatedly for the rest of the multiball.\nAll of the jackpots do not need to be collected in a single multiball- progress is carried across multiple multiballs. If the Super Jackpot was lit but never collected, it will be lit at the start of the next multiball as well. Collecting a super jackpot, though, means the jackpot sequence restarts for the next multiball- but with an increased multiplier for all jackpots, including the super jackpot. The jackpot sequence can be completed repeatedly to continue increasing the jackpot multiplier, up to a maximum of 6X Jackpots if at least one super jackpot has been collected on five separate previous multiballs.\nIf 3 balls are in play, jackpots can be doubled again, on top of the multipliers discussed in the previous paragraph. To do this, relock two different balls in the Caster's Club- the second one will restart the jackpot timer at 15 seconds and double the lit jackpot if collected during that time. This can only be used on the three tackle box jackpots, not the Super Jackpot. A drop target will pop up in front of Caster's Club to prevent the player from relocking a third ball during 3-ball multiball, or from relocking the second ball if multiball is down to 2 balls.\nRock the Boat and Monster Fish can still be started and collected during multiball. Watch the lights on the playfield and listen for their callouts to keep tabs on this. A really good Rock the Boat round, especially, can out score multiple jackpots if played will during multiball.\nDuring multiball, putting two different balls up the two different center ramps at close to the same time scores a 5,000,000 point Double Cross. This is very hard to do and comes with a rare and cool looking DMD animation.\nFish Tales has a conventional in/out lane setup. The out lanes are lit for special by hitting the captive ball a certain number of times after collecting the Instant Multiball award- typically 4. The left in lane lights the right center ramp for progress towards Monster Fish and always lights the right orbit for Long Cast. The right in lane always lights the left center ramp for Monster Fish progress, and it will also light the Fish Finder when lit. The right in lane can be lit by completing the L-I-E letters at the top of the playfield.\nBonus is equal to miscellaneous small points per switch hit, plus 250,000 points per fish caught (from the lower standup targets) plus 500,000 points per tale told (from the left spinner after catching a fish).Bonus multiplier is advanced by completing the L-I-E top lanes, accessed by the left orbit (always) or right orbit (only when Long Cast is NOT lit). Bonus multiplier maxes out at 7x, so max bonus is 7x 3,000,000 = 21,000,000 points. Completing the L-I-E lanes also lights the right in lane if it is not already lit, and removes the lowest scoring option from the spinner value for the next Stretch the Truth.\nBonus cannot be collected mid-ball. The fish caught and tales told counts in the bonus are cumulative throughout the game so far, so they always carry over and build from ball to ball. Bonus multiplier can only be carried over via the Hold Bonus award from the captive ball or the Fish Finder, though. If the Hold Bonus award is received on the final ball of the game and no extra balls are earned, the end of ball bonus will be counted and scored twice when that ball drains.\nIn competition/novelty play, specials score a measly 1,000,000 points. Extra balls cannot be set to have a point value.\nThe following timers can be adjusted: the amount of time a center ramp is lit (5-20 seconds), the amount of time Fish Finder is lit (3-20 seconds), the time for which Stretch the Truth is lit (5-30 seconds), and the time on the ball saver at the beginning of the ball (4-20 seconds).\nThe game may start with none, some, or all of the captive ball awards flashing.\nThe out lane specials can be set to light after anywhere from 1 to 10 hits of Sell Yer Gear (by hitting the captive ball repeatedly on the same ball after finishing the awards)."

Bad first ball and you may be toast. The top colored lanes each light the same-colored stand-up targets elsewhere on the playfield. Red is upper right corner, white middle left, blue lower left. Hitting one of these lit targets enables the \u201csecond ball launcher\u201d locks for multiball. It\u2019s key to get a lane on the plunge because the only other way you\u2019re likely to get one is from a shot through the top spinner with the far upper-left flipper. When you do have the ball on the upper flipper, go for the spinner towards the top colored lanes whenever you have less than all three completed. The two locks are one dead center and one just right of the lower right flipper. It\u2019s not uncommon to have a ball go into the lower lock on its own. After you lock a ball, you just plunge a second ball and multiball begins when you hit a switch. During multiball, smack targets all day; drops score 5K, completing them scores 5K plus another 5K per lit target. Default setting is to have two lights on for each bank to start the game, so that\u2019s 15K. Each set completion spots another light on it. The two far upper left lanes score 3K per lit red (left) target and 3K per lit blue (right) target respectively, so that can be big value; with the usual 2-per-side to start, it\u2019s 12K initially for a ball through both. When multiball ends, simply hit a lit target again to relight your locks. Stand-up targets stay lit once hit for the remainder of the game unless you complete all three; they then reset when your ball drains. Completed and partial drop target banks are also preserved from ball to ball. Center lock saucer when not lit spots a left drop target; lower lock spots a right target. Bonus is built by drop targets and goes up to 29K. Bonus multiplier is advanced by completing a set of drop targets or a lit return or outlane, up to 6X; the 1X, 2X and 3X will light cumulatively for multipliers over 3X. Total bonus can thus reach 174K. Since so much is preserved from ball to ball, getting your stand-up targets lit on ball one is imperative. The more drop target set completions on ball one the better as well since their raised value is preserved. Extra balls should be off, but when on are earned by getting all three colored lanes and then finishing the upper left (white) drop target bank. The PAPA Force II in their gameplay video does not appear to score the blue drop targets properly.\nPinVideosMatch Play*youtubeOPDBIPDBFlyer*\nForce II SS - Gottlieb | 1981\nShortname: FII\nPlayers: 4\nDisplay: alphanumeric",
        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/force2_G5Wpk.html": "Try to always be in multiball. Red, white, and blue top lanes light the upper right, middle left, and lower left standup targets respectively. Hit a lit standup target to qualify the center saucer and the kicker next to the right flipper for a lock; lock a ball to start 2-ball multiball. In multiball, clear drop target banks for bonus multipliers and increasing scoring. Extra ball comes from clearing the white drop targets after collecting all three colour lanes.\nTop lanes always score 5,000 points. Roll through a lit lane to unlight that lane and light one of the standup targets around the playfield. The upper right standup target near the bumpers is red; the middle left standup target is white; the lower left standup target is blue. Standup targets score 5,000 points and a bonus advance. If a standup target is lit, hitting it will light the center saucer and the kicker lane behind the right flipper for a lock.Making a ball into the saucer or kicker when lit will start 2-ball multiball. When not lit, during a 3-ball game only, the center saucer spots a red drop target, and the right kicker spots a blue drop target.There are no specific scoring rules or multipliers during multiball; it is merely a chance to make other progress on the table with the safety net of a second ball in play.\nThe only way to return to the top of the table for additional top lanes is an awkwardly angled shot through the spinner in the top-center of the table, which always scores 1,000 points per spin. The only time collected colour lanes reset is if all 3 have been collected, and then the ball drains- otherwise, coloured lanes are preserved. When a multiball ends, standup targets stay lit, and hitting any one of them instantly relights the locks. Colours are also preserved if the ball drains with just 1 or 2 of them lit.\nLit drop targets score 5,000 points. Unlit drop targets score 500 points. Any drop target down scores a bonus advance. Clearing a target bank scores 5,000 points times the number of lit targets, increases the bonus multiplier by 1x, lights one additional target, and resets the target bank. The number of lit targets is carried over from ball to ball, unless all 5 were lit, in which case draining the ball resets that bank back to 3 lit targets. On a 5-ball game, only 1 target is lit for free at the start of the game; on a 3-ball game, 2 targets are lit at the start of the game.\nAny target down in this bank scores 5,000 points and a bonus advance. Just like the red and blue target banks, completing this bank increases the bonus multiplier. If the red, white, and blue lights from the top lanes have all been collected, completing the white target bank scores an extra ball.\nThe upper left side lane is nearly impossible to reach from any flipper. A lucky ricochet or a very precise use of the upper left flipper is required to make it through this tiny loop. The switches in this lane score 3,000 points for each lit target in the red bank (upper switch) and blue bank (lower switch). This lane's minimum value is 6,000 points in a 5-ball game and 12,000 points in a 3-ball game.\nThe left side of the table bottom is conventional. On the right, there is no slingshot, and there are two lanes just to the right of the flipper; the first is the kicker/lower lock lane, and the second is an out lane. The two out lanes alternate being lit for 10,000 points and a bonus multiplier every few seconds. The left in lane is lit for bonus multiplier only if the white top lane has been collected. The kicker spots a blue target when not lit and starts multiball when lit after a lit standup target has been scored.\nBonus is advanced by any drop target down and by each of the two switches in the upper left side lane. Max base bonus is 29,000 points. Bonus multiplier is advanced by completing any drop target bank or any lit in/out lane. Max bonus multiplier is 6x. Max bonus is 6x 29,000 = 174,000 points. There is no holdover for base bonus or multiplier and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.\nIn competition/novelty play, specials and extra balls both score 50,000 points.\nWhen originally produced, this game only featured 6-digit displays. However, scores over 1,000,000 points are not uncommon. Watch the scoreboard closely to ensure score rollovers are adequately recorded."

        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/funhouse_G5Dz7.html": "Bumpers, targets, ramps, and the top scoop all advance the clock time. Advance to 11:30, then lock two balls at the center shot just to the right of the top scoop. At midnight, shoot into Rudy's open mouth with the upper flipper for 1,000,000 points and multiball. During multiball, the trapdoor shot scores Millions-Plus, and the left ramp reopens the trapdoor. To collect Mirror items toward Super Frenzy, light the mirror by hitting Rudy in the jaw or going through the far right in lane.\nThe main skill shot is a precise-power plunge that slows up at the top of the table just enough to fall into a hidden saucer behind Rudy's head. The skill shot scores 250,000 the first time, an additional 250,000 subsequent times, and a max of 1,000,000 points.\nAn alternate plunge strategy is to plunge very lightly so the ball goes through the small lane that \"connects\" to the far in lane. This small, out of the way lane advances the bumpers (lighting one that is unlit, or if all three are lit, turning a lit bumper into a flashing one).\nAt the beginning of the game, the clock is set to 8:00. If multiball has been played already, the clock is set to 5:00. The goal of the clock is to hit enough shots and targets that award minutes to advance the clock all the way to 11:30, when lock is lit at the Hidden Hallway center lane. The following features award clock time:\n5 minutes from lit pop bumpers, the blue Step targets, or the Superdog targets in the center of the playfield\n10 minutes from flashing pop bumpers, the Hidden Hallway center shot, or any shot to the Trapdoor loop\n15 minutes from the Wind Tunnel top scoop\n15, then 20, then 25, then 30 minutes from the left ramp\n30 minutes for the Crazy Steps manhole below the pop bumpers that can only be reached with good pop bumper luck\nAt 11:30, the clock can only be advanced by locking a ball in the Hidden Hallway. The first lock moves the clock to 11:45; the second moves the clock to Midnight. At midnight, Rudy falls asleep with his mouth open; shoot the ball into his mouth for 1,000,000 points and multiball.Advancing the clock to 11:30 twice in a single game lights the out lanes alternately for a Special.\nIf it is not lit, the Wind Tunnel top scoop scores 15 minutes and 10,000 points. It can be lit for Mystery Mirror temporarily by going through the far right in lane, or solidly until collected by hitting Rudy in the jaw during regular gameplay. Making the scoop when the Mirror is lit awards the flashing award, which is rotated by the pop bumpers. The awards are:\nLight Extra Ball (at the Hidden Hallway)\nLight Million (for the next hit to Rudy)\nJet Bumpers at Max (all three start flashing)\nLight Superdog (see below)\nOpen Crazy Steps (see below)\nQuick Multiball (see below)\nAfter collecting all 6 awards, the Mirror will immediately be lit for Super Frenzy. Collecting Super Frenzy locks the Mirror out from giving any more awards for the rest of the ball.\nThe left ramp scores 15 minutes and 75,000 points the first time it is made. Subsequent shots award 5 more minutes and 25,000 more points, up to a maximum of 30 minutes and 150,000 points. Playing standard Multiball or draining the ball resets the ramp's value. In standard multiball, the ramp scores 250,000 points.\nCollecting the Open Steps mirror award or having the ball go in the manhole just below the bumpers redirects the ball into the left out lane from this ramp, with a gate open so the left plunger can be used. Four awards can be available from this left plunge, but only two are initially lit; the other two must be lit before going into the left plunger lane by completing the Step standup targets around the playfield. The four awards, from weakest to strongest left plunge, are:\nLight Frenzy (on to start the game)\nLight extra ball (requires 2 spellings of Step to light initially, and can only be collected once per game)\n500,000 points (requires 1 spelling of Step to light initially)\nSuperdog (always available from a full elft plunge)\nCollecting a lit award unlights it. Collecting Light Extra Ball also unlights the 500,000 points step. Unlit steps score 100,000 points. There are no special awards for landing on Light Frenzy when Frenzy was already lit, but if a Frenzy wasrunning, Light Frenzy will add 20 seconds to the Frenzy timer. Similarly, collecting Superdog from the Steps left plunger while Superdog was already running adds 20 seconds to that timer as well.\nStarted by shooting into the Wind Tunnel scoop when the Mirror is lit and Quick Multiball is the flashing award. Quick Multiball is a 2-ball multiball where everything is in play, with the addition of all shots to Rudy's mouth being worth 1,000,000 points until one of the two balls drains. The clock cannot be advanced past 11:25 until Quick Multiball ends.\nAdvance the clock to 11:30, then lock two balls at the Hidden Hallway to advance the clock to Midnight. Then, shoot the third ball into Rudy's mouth to score 1,000,000 points and start 3-ball multiball. During standard multiball, the trap door (upper loop shot slightly later than Rudy's mouth) scores Millions-Plus- 2,000,000 the first time, an additional 1,000,000 each subsequent time, maxing out at 10,000,000. The trap door is open at the start of the multiball, but each time it is collected, it must be reopened with a left ramp shot. The Steps and the Mystery Mirror are not in play during standard multiball.\nIf single ball play resumes before a Millions-Plus is collected from the trapdoor, a multiball restart is available from the Hidden Hallway for 12 seconds. This starts a 2-ball multiball with the Standard Multiball rules where Millions-Plus can be collected once again.\nBoth Quick Multiball and Standard Multiball can be played at once, but it's difficult to do. First, Quick Multiball must be the only remaining Mirror award. Then, the clock must be advanced to midnight by locking two balls at the Hidden Hallway. Finally,QuickMultiball must be started, not the regular multiball. Following this exact order will start both Quick Multiball and Standard Multiball together, which means both the unlimited million from shooting Rudy and the Millions-Plus from the trapdoor are available.\nGoing through the left in lane or making the right orbit (between the bumpers) lights the right orbit for Gangway. Similarly, going through the near right in lane or making the left orbit lights the left orbit for Gangway. The current value of a Gangway is shown by the inserts near the flippers at the bottom of the playfield. Scoring a Gangway also advances the value. The order is 75,000 - 100,000 - 150,000 - 200,000 - 250,000 - 250,000 and light extra ball. Progress on the Gangway is carried over from ball to ball, but only until the Extra Ball at the end of the line is lit; after that, the value resets to 75,000 after each ball. Lighting the extra ball also resets the Gangway value.\nFrenzy is lit from the nearest Crazy Steps award. Super Frenzy is started by making the Wind Tunnel top scoop after previously collecting all 6 Mirror awards. During a Frenzy, every switch in the game adds points to the Frenzy Bonus that is awarded at the end of the ball- 50,000 per switch for Funhouse Frenzy, and 100,000 per switch for Super Frenzy. The Frenzy Bonus starts at 150,000 points in Funhouse Frenzy and 1,500,000 points in Super Frenzy. To reiterate, the Frenzy Bonus is added to the end-of-ball bonus, not awarded directly- so absolutely don't tilt on a ball where either flavor of Frenzy was played!!If both types of Frenzy are running at the same time, the combined Frenzy will always be a Super Frenzy, with a time limit equal to 20 seconds plus the amount of time that was left on the first Frenzy's clock when the second one was started. This applies no matter which order Frenzy and Super Frenzy were started in.The clock cannot be advanced past 11:25 during any Frenzy.\nSuperdog is started by a full plunge from the left Steps plunger, or from the mirror award. For 20 seconds, the three standup targets in the center of the playfield all score 200,000 points. Hitting any target increases the value of the targets by 25,000 points. If Superdog is awarded while Superdog was running, 20 seconds are added to the current timer.\nThe Light Million mirror award makes the next shot to Rudy's mouth score 1,000,000 points. This can be \"stacked\" with the Million shot for starting multiball, allowing both to be collected at once for 2,000,000 points.Making the skill shot saucer during normal gameplay, typically via a somewhat weak left orbit shot, scores 75,000 points for Rudy's Hideout.Hitting Rudy in the mouth between 6 and 12 times (depending on the game and how long it's been since the last high score reset) scores the Sausage Bonus of 1,000,000 points.If the ball is shot into Rudy's mouth while he is talking, but when his mouth would not otherwise be open, a Rudy Gulp worth 250,000 points is scored.\nLeft ramp -> right Gangway (orbit) -> Trapdoor loop is a Three way combo worth 500,000 points. Tacking a shot to Rudy's mouth on the end makes it a Four way combo worth an additional 1,000,000 points. If the left ramp is set up to put the ball in the Steps plunger lane, then left ramp -> steps plunge -> trapdoor loop -> trapdoor loop again also counts as a Three way combo, and Rudy can be tacked onto the end to make that a Four way combo as well.\nUnlit bumpers score 1,000 points and no clock time. Lit bumpers score 2,000 points and 5 minutes of time. Flashing bumpers score 3,000 points and 10 minutes of time. The small angled lane that leads to the right far in lane- makeable from a short plunge or pop bumper luck- advances one bumper, or the Bumpers at Max mirror award will instantly start all 3 bumpers flashing. When the ball drains, the bumpers will be reset to their base value of 1 lit + 2 unlit for the next ball. A ball getting stuck in the flashing pop bumpers is one of the best ways to build the clock toward a multiball.\nFunhouse has a conventional in/out lane setup, but with two in lanes on the right side instead of one. The out lanes are lit alternate for a special by making it to 11:30 on the clock twice in a single game. If Crazy Steps has been collected from the Mirror but not used yet, the left out lane is not actually a drain, and serves as just another way to use the Steps plunger.The left in lane lights the right Gangway orbit for its value. The right near in lane lights the left Gangway orbit for its value. The right far in lane lights the Mystery Mirror for about 5 seconds.\nBase bonus is just 50,000 points for each time Rudy is hit with a shot over the course of a game. There is no way to multiply this bonus. The only other score that gets added at the end of the ball is whatever is in the Frenzy Bonus pot, if a Frenzy or Super Frenzy was played on that ball. End of ball bonus is pretty negligible if it's just from shooting Rudy, but if you played a Frenzy, don't let the machine even think about tilting away that bonus.\nIn competition/tournament play, specials score 1,000,000 points. Extra balls cannot be set to have a point value.\nThe starting clock position for the first multiball, and for all multiballs after the first together, can be set to anywhere from 3:00 to 10:00.\nThe Hidden Hallway multiball restart can be set to \"long\", which still counts down from 12 seconds but doesn't actually count down in real seconds, giving about 20 real seconds for the restart.\nThe Gangway's starting value at the beginning of a game can be set to any of the first 5 values (75,000 through 250,000 points).\nRudy's Jaw can be set not to light the Mirror at all. If this is the case, the far right in lane is the only way to light the Mirror for an award, and remember it only does so for about 5 seconds. Turning this off is not very fun and would only be done by sadistic operators on very hard settings.\nThe mirror can be on to start each ball, off to start each ball, or start the game on or off and have memory between balls.\nThe Frenzy can be lit at the very start of the game. This would only be done for very easy settings."

That\u2019s the key, cradling. Base bonus goes up 2K for each letter you\u2019ve collected in Future Spa. The Future letters are collected through repeated top shots with necessary nudging. The Spa letters are made by hitting the center standup target. But don\u2019t shoot at it, since it\u2019s a drain risk; you also get letters from the inlines and the kickback, so just stick with the drops and UTAD and let the spa letters come from random hits and kickbacks. The only time I\u2019d shoot the spa target is if I needed just one more spa letter to complete the 9-letter set. When you complete all 9 letters, you light the 18K super bonus, which carries over to later balls. A second set moves you up to 36K, and you can also get 8 more letters for another 16K, for a max base of 52K and max total bonus of 312K. If you finish the letters a third time, you\u2019re awarded a special and the letters reset. If specials are set to score points, it\u2019s worth finishing; if not, stop one shy of your third set. You\u2019ll find that you lose most of your balls down the left side on this game. There are four lanes on the left, with the far left one a permanent kickback award [3K, goes up 2K each time collected to a max of 9K], then an outlane, then a may-or-may-not return lane, then a return lane. The either-or lane is managed by a gate, which begins each ball angled to the right, making it an outlane. Skill shooting or otherwise getting the ball through a lit top lane [one of the two center ones] flips the gate straight up to make it a return lane. The right side top saucer and horseshoe both rise in value each time you make them, the saucer from 3K to 9K in 3K increments, the horseshoe from 2K to 10K in increments of 2K. Both of these values reset each ball. Most of the time, though, you\u2019re better off shooting the spinner to go up top for more letters in Future. Only if you have Future finished would I consider shooting the horseshoe instead. Horseshoe shots exit to the top right bumper, which thumps them somewhat towards that saucer, so you can sometimes get three scores for one shot \u2013 the horseshoe rollover plus the bumper value and a saucer.\nPinVideosMatch Play*youtubeOPDBIPDBFlyer*\nFuture Spa SS - Bally | 1979\nShortname: FS\nPlayers: 4\nDisplay: alphanumeric",

After that, shoot either lit spinner, trying to complete the Future letters at the top lanes and hoping that Spa letters are spotted on the way to build the bonus.\nEach lane scores 500 points. Lit lanes collect the corresponding letter. One of the two center lanes (T, or second U) will be lit with a yellow arrow whose placements alternates with bumper or slingshot hits. Going through the yellow arrow lane turns one of the left out lanes into a single-use second left in lane (see Bottom of the table below). If Future has been completed but Spa has not within the current spelling of Future Spa (which is rare), the first U and the R will alternate being lit with a green arrow for 5,000 points. If the entire phrase Future Spa is completed, the lit green lane will unlight.\nThe star rollover at the back of the candy cane/horseshoe lane scores and advances the lit value, and spots one letter in Future Spa. The lit value starts at 2,000 points, increases by 2,000 each hit, and maxes out at 10,000 points.The saucer nestled inside the hook of the candy cane also scores and advances its own lit value, starting at 3,000 and stepping up to 6,000 and then 9,000. The saucer does not spot Future Spa letters.The point value of both the candy cane and the saucer resets between balls.\nScore 100 per spin, or 1,000/spin when lit. Both spinners are lit by knocking down the first of the inline drop targets. Spinners all day when lit is a very good scoring strategy for after 6x bonus is obtained.\nEach drop target scores 400 points, and spots a Future Spa letter when lit. The bank is lit for Future Spa letters 1/3 of the time, rotating with the left kickback lane and with both of the two being off, by each pop bumper and slingshot hit. The first drop target lights both spinners; the second lights 2x bonus; the third lights 4x bonus; the fourth maxes the multiplier at 6x and exposes a standup target in the bank. That standup target scores extra ball the first time it is hit, a special the second time, and 20,000 points all subsequent times for the rest of the ball.At the very least, hit the first target to light the spinners and rip the spinners all day. It is recommended to get to 6x bonus from this lane before moving on from it as a strategy, though.\nIf the three letters of Spa have not all been completed in the current set, this target spots one of them and scores 500 points. If Spa is currently finished, this target scores 5,000 points instead.\nThere are 4 lanes on the left side. The leftmost lane is a permanent kickback: it scores 3,000 points the first time it is used, increasing by an additional 2,000 on subsequent uses to a maximum value of 9,000 points. The second lane from left is always an out lane. The third lane from left is an out lane by default, but can be turned into an in lane for a single use through the means of a rotating gate by going through the top Future lane that is lit with a yellow arrow. The fourth lane from left is always an in lane. Lanes 2, 3, and 4 all score 500 points, unless the gate is open to make lane 3 an in lane, in which case using up the gate scores 3,000 points. The left slingshot is a conventional size and shape, and scores 10 points.\nOn the right are two bumpers. The one with the symbol always scores 100 points, like the bumpers in the upper playfield. The other bumper scores 100 points or 1,000 when lit, and is lit whenever Spa is completed, unlighting when a completion of Future Spa resets all letters. Underneath the bumpers is a wireform with a cutout that the ball can fall into. This makes the whole lower right area similar in spirit and strategy to the Beast Lair on Paragon. Do what it takes to prevent the ball from going over here, with up nudges where necessary to pop the ball over the gap. Instead of a conventional slingshot, there is a very small triangle with a passive rubber switch where the slingshot should be that scores 30 points and merely lets the ball bounce rather than being kicked away.\nBonus is counted as 2,000 points for each letter in Future Spa collected. Letters are collected from around the table as described above. Completing Future Spa once lights an 18,000 super bonus, allowing the bonus to be built further. The second completion turns that super bonus into a 36,000 super bonus. The third completion, though, scores a special and resets the bonus back to 36,000 points. Max base bonus, then, is 52,000, achieved by completing Future Spa twice and then collect 8 of the 9 letters toward a third completion.Bonus multiplier is collected from the second (2x), third (4x), and fourth (6x) inline drop targets. Max bonus is 6x 52,000 = 312,000 points. Only the 18,000 and 36,000 super bonuses are carried over as part of the base bonus. Bonus multipliers are always reset.\nIn competition/novelty play, specials score 50,000 points, and extra balls score 25,000 points.\nThe yellow and green arrow lights in the Future lanes can be lit together instead of alternately.\nThe 1,000 bumper in the lower right of the game can be always on, instead of only turning on when Spa is completed.\nThe Spot Letter lights at the left kickback and inline drop target lanes can be set to always be on, instead of only being on 1/3 of the time.\nThe special from the inline drop target lane can be set to be repeatedly collectible, rather than the lane value switching to 20,000 points after one special is earned."

Unlight all three lanes to score a letter in Body. Spelling Body scores 50,000 points, and advances the playfield multiplier by 1x if Body has not already been lit for the current robot in progress.Lit lanes can be moved via lane change with either flipper, but both flippers move the lights forward; there is no backwards lane change.\nScore 1,000 points per hit times the playfield multiplier.

The left ramp gives Arms letters, while the right ramp gives Legs letters. The left ramp feeds the ball out just below the vary-target, while the right ramp spits the ball into the pop bumpers just under the C top lane.\nAfter a body part is collected (if it had not been collected already for the current robot), one of the ramps will flash. Shooting that ramp locks a ball and starts multiball. During multiball, everything is in play and there are no specific scoring features; just try to get more letters.

Going through an in lane causes Spot Letter in front of the vary-target to flash for a few seconds. During this time, a full shot to the target will spot a letter in every body part that is still needed for the current robot.\nWhen all 4 types of body part have been collected, as denoted by lights in the holding chamber in the middle of the table, the vary-target will flash for Lifeforce. A full shot when Lifeforce is lit will assemble and reveal the robot, light the specials, and reset the status of all body parts, allowing the playfield multiplier to be built up even further. There is no saucer or anything that holds the ball during the robot reveal animation, and it's quite a spectacular and distracting light show, so just try to hold the ball on a flipper until it concludes.\nEach drop target down scores 5,000 points. To begin, the drop target labelled 1 will be flashing. Hit that target to start the 2 flashing, then hit that one to flash the 3. Hitting a flashing 3 target will spot a letter in whichever needed body part is closest to completion. If all four body parts have the same number of letters lit, a letter will be spotted in all of them. This award does not need to be done in a single completion of the drop targets: if they are hti out of order, progress resumes when the bank resets after all 3 have been knocked down.\nThe body parts that have been collected already on the current robot will be lit up under the large plastic trapezoid in the middle of the table. When a body part is completed, it only increases the playfield multiplier and enables a lock for multiball if it has not already been collected for the current robot. \"Playfield multiplier\" is just that- it is a multiplier to all scoring in the game. To get a playfield multiplier from a certain body part a second time, the entire robot will need to be completed first. Once a robot is completed, the playfield multiplier continues to build. If there is a limit for the playfield multiplier, it is at least 13X. The playfield multiplier itself is doubled for the duration of multiball. Playfield multiplier is carried over from ball to ball.\nOne is lit alternately for 10,000 points. The other scores 1,000. Slingshots alternate which of these targets is lit. When a robot is completed and the light show unveils it, the target not lit for 10,000 points will be lit for a special instead.\nGenesis has a conventional in lane/out lane setup. The out lanes score 5,000 points, or 50,000 when lit. One lane will always be lit, and bumpers and slingshots alternate which one that is. The in lanes always score 1,000 points and cannot be lit for any other value. There are two flippers in the standard position, and no center post.\nHow exactly these work is somewhat unintuitive. Collecting two non-duplicate body parts on a single ball will light the left insert, which many people assume shows that they have an extra ball since that's what the light reads. However, in tiny text around the light is \"Next Part Awards\", meaning one more non-duplicate body part needs to be collected to actually earn the extra ball. If this is done, the right lamp lights up, which is the actual Shoot Again light. So, the extra ball comes from collecting three non-duplicate body parts in one ball, and the lamp on the left is just to signal that only one more part remains.\nBonus is pretty much the only thing that is not multiplied by the playfield multiplier in this game. At the end of the ball, 10,000 points are scored for each currently lit letter on the back of the game. Previously completed body parts are not accounted for in any way. This makes bonus extremely negligible in the grand scheme of scoring.Bonus is also collected when a robot is completed at the vary-target. No matter what, though, it can't be worth more than 130,000, and should be ignored in favor of just finishing the body parts.\nSpecial can be set to an extra ball or 500,000 points instead of a free game. Extra ball can also be set to 500,000 points on novelty/tournament play.\nNext Part Awards Extra Ball can be lit after 2 or 3 body parts, meaning it can require 4 completed parts in a single ball to get the EB instead of 3.\nThe special on the side targets can be lit as soon as the fourth unique body part is completed, rather than after the vary-target is hit/during the reveal animation."

Worse comes to worst when former associates and fellow assassins aim to take John down. With the help of Winston, owner of the New York Continental, and other allies, John must defeat the members of the High Table.John Wickis the first pinball machine designed by former mechanical engineer Elliot Eismin and takes influence from all four mainline films in the series.\nShoot the weapons case / VUK to light jobs, then VUK to start them. Lit shots during jobs are only scored if the enemies (blue circles) at that shot have been cleared out with prior shots.\nDefeat enemies during single-ball play to light left eject for battle. Battles are single-ball modes with a long ball save but you need to cash out by hitting all of the bash toys (blood marker, red circle, car, captive ball, job VUK), then the left eject again. Battles prevent progress towards other objectives while running.\nBash car enough times to light car chase multiball at left orbit (four for the first multiball on Pro, two on Prem / LE). On default settings they are played in a random order.\nCaptive ball spells WINSTON to light locks for deconsecrated multiball at the center ramp.\nOrange targets near the ramps light excommunicado multiball at the Red Circle.\nBlood marker (left) standup targets light outlane ball save.\nThese modes are accessible by holding both flipper buttons during attract mode until a menu appears. The following options are available:\nStandard:See below for full rulesheet.\nCompetition:Specific Jobs are tied to specific factions (randomized in standard), Car multi-balls are played in order (not based on daily random seed).\nDJ MixerNOT a gameplay mode. This mode operates like a jukebox, allowing you to play the music featured in the machine, including a number of specific playlists.\nCompetition InstallNot from the gameplay menu, but the following is changed if a Competition Install is performed from the utilities menu:\nPlunge the ball into the right VUK, without hitting any other switches, for a crate skill shot. This starts a job + scores 1.5M if no switches were hit, advances towards lighting job + scores 750k if one switch was hit, and scores lower if switches were hit.\nPlunge the ball into the backdoor to the Red Circle club for a VIP skill shot. Starts at 650k.\n(Prem / LE) Plunge the ball behind the car for a car skill shot. Starts at 850k.\nShoot the weapons crate or the right VUK to advance the blue lights in front of the crate. Once all three are lit solid, the right VUK will light to start the next job. Starting any job will spawnenemiesand is a quick way to spawn them if none are currently available.Alliescan be used during jobs if qualified by shooting their respective shots.\nEach job is timed for 60 seconds, with 3 seconds added for each shot made. The timer can also be extended by 30 seconds, once per job, by completing the weapons crate targets and then shooting the right VUK to boost the timer.\nThere are seven factions to complete jobs for and each of the seven jobs is assigned to one of the factions. The job that each faction is assigned to will vary each game, but is the same for all players (exp: the faction assigned the Gather Intel job will be the same faction for players 1-4). In competition mode the job that each faction is assigned is always the same. The color of the job shots is determined by the faction not by the job assignment.\nYou can select which faction you want to start a job for by shooting the associated shot for that faction to light its insert before you start a job.\nMapping of shots to factions:Left Eject \u2192 The Bowery (Purple)Left Orbit/Spinner \u2192 New York Continental (Green)Left Ramp \u2192 Osaka Continental (Red)Red Circle \u2192 The High Table (White)Center Ramp \u2192 Ruska Roma (Yellow)Right Orbit \u2192 The Marquis De Gramont (Blue)Right Ramp \u2192 Tarasov Family (Orange)\nThe seven job types are:\nSecurity Detail- clear 3 waves of randomly lit shots.\nEscort the VIP- hit lit shot to move VIP from left to right orbit or back.\nNight Watch- hit all lit shots before they relight.\nAssassination- make 3 of any lit shot.\nTask a Crew- make all shots lit by hitting the flashing ones, which light more.\nHeist- clear 3 waves of lit shots (Red Circle, center ramp, right loop).\nGather Intel- shoot the left, center, and right ramps twice each.\nThe final shot for each job is at the left eject shot, and awards 20% of the total score from the completed job. Enemies at that shot must be cleared out before the final shot can be scored.\nPlay a job for all seven factions to qualifyThe Duel.\nCompetition mode job summary:\nAs soon as the first enemy shot (blue circle) is hit in a game, a location will be assigned. The player must defeat a certain amount ofenemieswhile in this location to light the left eject (the administration shot) for adversary battle. The required enemies are randomly chosen, based on the daily seed, from the following:\nJohn Wick\u2019s House (16 enemies)\nAbandoned Building - Paris (19 enemies)\nCatacombs (34 enemies)\nEnemies cannot be defeated for location progress while any multiball mode is active, though defeated enemies will still add to mode & jackpot values.\nAdversary battles are 200-second timed modes that can be changed (from left to right) with shots to the left standup targets to change which battle will start. These represent the one-on-one battles from the films, and take priority over all other game features. After enough shots are made during the battle, a 10M \u201cbe seeing you\u201d bonus is awarded. The shots required for \u201cbe seeing you\u201d are different in each battle, and it doesn\u2019t need to be collected to \u201ccomplete\u201d the battle; it just scores substantial points.\nEach adversary battle features an \u201cescape jackpot\u201d that is built up as lit shots are made but must be collected, and ends the battle once scored. To collect the built-up escape jackpot value, the player must first hit all five bash toys (the blood marker, Red Circle, car, captive ball / Continental, and crate), then hit the left eject to cash it out or keep going.\nOnce any adversary battle has been played, the blood marker\u2019s obligation will be fulfilled, and ball save will be requalified at the left standup targets if it has been used. If a lit ball save hasn\u2019t been used before a battle starts, +30 seconds will be added to the battle\u2019s initial ball save timer of 40 seconds.\nWhen the administration light is lit, the selected adversary battle can be toggled via the blood oath standup targets or the pop bumper.\nThe five adversaries are:\nViggo: Shoot the car or captive ball to light gold shots for bonuses. \u201cBe seeing you\u201d - awarded by hitting any lit shot (including gold shots) 12 times.\nKirill: Shoot the random flashing red shots, which alternate between left and right and decrease in quantity as they are made, to light the Red Circle for their combined total + 300k, which never resets. \u201cBe seeing you\u201d - awarded after collecting 12 shots.\nCassian: Switch frenzy mode (everything scores 2.5k and adds 10k to the jackpot). One shot is flashing purple for jackpot, which moves across the playfield as orange standup targets or pop bumpers are hit. The jackpot increases by 250k every time it is scored, but resets when all shots are relit upon hitting 100 switches. \u201cBe seeing you\u201d - awarded after scoring 6 jackpots.\nAres: All shots are lit white to score increasing points, but only one shot is lit red and moves sporadically. The red shot finds Ares and scores 3M + 1.25M for each red shot made, and can be seen for a brief time with pop bumper hits or slingshot hits. \u201cBe seeing you\u201d - awarded after making 8 red shots.\nZero: Combo mode. Shoot any light blue shot to score combos, then either the car, captive ball (1x collect), or left eject (2x collect) to complete them for 750k + 100k per combo completed + 250k for each combo shot made prior to collecting. \u201cBe seeing you\u201d - awarded after five combos have been cashed out.\nDefeat all five adversaries to qualifyThe Staircase.\nDuring any multiball, balls can be added (once per multiball) by completing the orange standup targets, then shooting the Administration shot (left eject).\nBash the car to light the left orbit for Car Chase Multiball. On Prem / LE models, the car can be hit from multiple angles and will lock the ball once the multiball starts.\nThe first multiball requires only two car hits to light, and is 2-ball (3-ball on Prem / LE). Subsequent multiballs add +1 more car hits to qualify, to a maximum of 4 (8 on Prem / LE, one hit for both front-facing and side-facing positions). On the Pro, the car must be lit by ripping the spinner first. Every car multiball played adds another ball to the multiball; after playing all four it resets to the base number +1 ball.\nThe car jackpot starts at 1M, and pink \u201caward\u201d shots during the multiballs score 20% of the car jackpot. It increases in the following ways:\nHit the car during single-ball play - adds 20% of the value for the hit (increased with spinner rips)\nAward shots during car multiballs (+5k)\nJackpots during car multiballs (+50k)\nSuper jackpots during car multiballs (+250k)\nThere are four different Car Chase Multiballs, and the order for all four multiballs is randomized by default based on the daily seed. They are listed here based on the order they were played in on launch code.\nHelipad Showdown: Shoot red shots to collect showdown awards and increase the jackpot awarded by hitting the car. Either a single, 2x, 3x, or 4x jackpot can be awarded based on how many \u201ccar\u201d inserts are lit (1 additional shot is needed to light each jackpot, so 9 shots are needed for a 4x jackpot). After four jackpots have been scored, the car can be hit for a super (5x) jackpot, and the left orbit can be shot for a 2x super jackpot.\nTaxicab Chase: Starts with a 15-second timed hurry-up to hit the car and lock in the hurry-up jackpot value (starting at the built car jackpot award). Shoot sets of lit chase awards to increase (and light) the jackpot at the car; the jackpot multiplier increases with each subsequent jackpot scored, and each jackpot requires one more award to light. After collecting four jackpots, the left orbit lights for a super (5x) jackpot, which can be further increased by bashing the car.\nMotorcycle Pursuit: Pursuit awards are lit at the Dance Floor and either \u201cleft-side\u201d shots (administration, left orbit, and left ramp), or \u201cright-side\u201d shots (center ramp, right orbit, and right ramp). Each shot made increases the car jackpot multiplier up to 4x. Hit the car to switch sides, relight the other side\u2019s shots, and score a jackpot if at least one pursuit award was collected. After collecting four jackpots, hit the Continental for a super jackpot. On the Premium/LE, the car will block the Continental; bash it to move it out of the way for a few seconds.\nBagarre a Letoile: Shoot any ramp to light the car for jackpots, and the orbits to increase the jackpot multiplier up to 4x & collect awards. The jackpot must be relit each time it has been scored. After collecting four jackpots, the car is lit to collect four super (5x) jackpots.\nComplete the three orange standup targets surrounding the left ramp and right ramp enough times to light the Red Circle for Excommunicado Multiball. Three target completions are required to light the first Excommunicado Multiball of a game.\nExcommunicado Multiball starts with a 15-second timed single-ball phase, with a ball save, where the player can hit shots to increase the jackpot value during the subsequent multiball (200k per shot, 125k per target). During this phase, orange target hits will add 5 seconds of time.\nOnce the timer expires, 2-ball multiball begins. Hit the red flashing shots on the left and right sides of the playfield for jackpots and the Red Circle w/ lit for super jackpot. If both shot paths are on the Red Circle at the same time, a 2x super jackpot will be scored.\nThe super jackpot is worth 1M + (2.5k x enemies this game) + (25k x enemies this ball) + (150k x enemies this mode).\nShoot the captive ball under the Continental to spell WINSTON and light the lock at the center ramp (virtual on Pro, physical on Prem / LE). Lock 3 balls there for Deconsecrated Multiball.\nOn the Pro, the captive ball must be hit two times (+1 per multiball) to light each individual lock, and the player must score a lock before completing WINSTON again. On the Prem / LE, all three locks are lit after spelling WINSTON, and five captive ball hits are required to light them initially.\nDuring Deconsecrated Multiball, shoot the green shots to score awards worth 200k + (25k x enemies this mode) and increase the multiplier for the captive ball jackpot (indicated by how many letters in WINSTON are flashing), which starts at 500k + (75k x enemies this mode) + (5k x enemies this ball). If jackpot isn\u2019t lit at the captive ball, it will spot an award instead.\nFor the first round of jackpots, each shot lights one letter in WINSTON, but later jackpot rounds light a WINSTON letter with every two shots. Once all the letters in WINSTON have been lit by collecting jackpots, shoot the center ramp for the super jackpot worth the jackpot total. The jackpot sequence then resets.\nThe super jackpot is worth 2.5M + (2.5k x enemies this game) + (25k x enemies this ball) + (250k x enemies this mode).\nEnemies spawn in several ways:\nOne spawns every 20 seconds by default.\nAt the start of the ball, a number of enemies will spawn based on the current number of the ball in play (ie. on ball 2, 2 enemies will spawn).\nEveryjobormultiballplayed will spawn +1 enemy. This total is reset as soon as abattleis played.\nHit 4 total switches in the Red Circle to spawn an enemy.\nFall into the VIP lane above the Red Circle to spawn an enemy.\nEnemies take priority over other shots they are lit at. Defeat enemies to increase the shot values duringjobsandmultiballs. Up to three enemies can be spawned per shot at a time. Solidly lit blue inserts correspond to armored enemies, which require two shots to defeat.\nDuring single-ball play, defeating enemies will also count down towards lighting the left eject foradversary battle. This rule is disabled during multiball play.\nOver the course of the game, enemy difficulty will increase based on the shots that the player is currently struggling or needs to make. Enemies might also shift between shots.\nDefeat 10 enemies to lightextra ball.\nSpell YAGA to light the action button to enable Lights Out, by cycling the lit inlanes - you can only collect YAGA letters if spotted at a lane where an insert in BABA is already lit. If Lights Out is already available or currently running, spelling YAGA adds a motion sensor.\nLights Out turns off all playfield lighting (excluding inlanes / outlanes, the blood marker, and the shoot again insert), but increases all scoring by 2x for 30 seconds. If the player has a motion sensor, they can press the action button to place it. Motion sensors light up a random area of the playfield (typically one or two shots\u2019 worth), and add +20 seconds to the playfield multiplier timer. Only one motion sensor can be placed at a time.\nLights Out remains lit across balls if it isn\u2019t used, and motion sensors are also carried across balls, but progress towards spelling YAGA resets at the end of every ball.\nShoot the left, center, or right ramp while no modes are running to qualify allies. Allies will help you out during the nextjobormultiballmode by clearing outenemiesin unique ways.\nAs soon as the job or multiball ends, the ally will be disqualified and must be qualified again by hitting their respective ramp one more time than before.\nThe three allies are:\nAkira: Left ramp. Defeats all enemies at the shot that currently has the most enemies active, prioritized from the left to right side of the playfield.\nCharon: Center ramp. Destroys all \u201carmored\u201d (ie. solidly lit) enemies on the playfield, ie. solidly lit blue circles will start flashing as they normally do and only require one hit.\nKatia: Right ramp. Defeats 1 unarmored enemy at all shots where there are unarmored enemies.\nBounces into the gold coin targets (above the weapons crate) light random shots for gold coins, or increase the coin value if they are already lit. The coin value starts at 200k and only one shot can be lit for a gold coin at a time.\nHit any of the left standup targets 4 times to light an outlane for marker ball save. The flashing outlane can be changed by pressing the flippers. If a ball save is already lit, the targets will add to the value. Ball save can be requalified by playing anadversary battle, fulfilling the blood marker\u2019s obligation in the process.\nIf a ball save is lit, but hasn\u2019t been collected yet, and the player starts anadversary battle, the ball save will be converted to +10 seconds of ball save time during the battle. They cannot be used during battles.\nExtra ball is lit at the left eject after:\nDefeating enoughenemies(approx. 10 for the first extra ball)\nPlaying fourjobs\nExtra balls score 10M if disabled.\nLit after playing ajobfor all seven factions.\nLit after defeating all fiveadversaries.\nLit after playing bothThe DuelandThe Staircase.\nThanks as always for getting this started so quickly!\n@CaptainBZarre, looks like I can\u2019t edit this rulesheet like I can the others. Can you open it up to everyone to make edits?\nEdit:Can someone wiki this post so we can all add edits?@joecan you help with this?\nRulesheet has been Wikified.  Thanks as always to@CaptainBZarrefor the diligence in getting these sheets drafted so quickly.\nHow do the inlane rollovers work?  I\u2019ve got an idea.\nWhen viewing them on stream it kind of looks like they have a Barracora vibe where the right flipper works the top \u201cBABA\u201d set (and they move only right) and the left flipper works the bottom \u201cYAGA\u201d set (and they move only left).  And similar to the Barracora rollovers if the top row letter is unlit when rolled over it will light (but not the bottom), and if lit it will light the bottom row letter (if unlit).\nI think BABA controls the bonus multiplier.  The YAGA might light something not coded in yet (\u201cLights Out\u201d) but I\u2019m not sure.\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a better way to explain that, but it\u2019s effectively Barracora.\nYes I think you\u2019re right. They behaved that way for me.\nThis is correct. BABA increases the bonus X and is controlled with the right flipper. YAGA qualifies lights out (playfield X) and is controlled with the left flipper + can only be lit at lanes that already have a BABA letter lit.\nMade edits to the Jobs section. Even though the jobs appear to be randomly assigned to a diff faction every game, it is the same faction for all players. In a tournament setting, if you pay attention to what job your opponents get and the faction it was assigned to, you can then choose to play that same job or avoid that faction if it is a job that you don\u2019t want to play.\nI haven\u2019t played the game enough, but as of code .81, it seems like Gather Intel and Assassination are the two best jobs scoring wise.\nIs \u201cThe Duel\u201d in the code yet?  I played all the modes, then re-lit and went back in the scoop, and it restarted a mode I already played.  So I figure either it isn\u2019t coded, or I needed to complete something I hadn\u2019t the first time.\nAlso, does anyone know if you can stack adversary battles into the various multiballs?  (You can definitely start a regular mode then start a MB)\nDuel and Staircase are TBD. The game is currently onveryearly code (0.81) so they might take a bit to add.\nAdversary battles are mutually exclusive and nothing else can be brought into them or stacked during them. Job modes can be stacked with multiballs, but can only be started in single-ball play.\nRelease notes for 0.84 say:\nBall Save:Increased the default Ball Save time to 9 seconds.Added checks to prevent the initial ball save from timing down when theball is in the Red Circle Dance Club or the Crate VUK.\nIncreased the default Ball Save time to 9 seconds.\nAdded checks to prevent the initial ball save from timing down when theball is in the Red Circle Dance Club or the Crate VUK.\nBut I am seeing that the first ball of a game still has an extremely short ball save timeout - especially if you skillshot into the VUK and let the callout complete, the ball save lamp will be rapidly flashing by the time the VUK fires, giving you maybe 2 seconds of playfield ball save time. Known issue? Anyone else seeing this?\nshouldn\u2019t all timers stop when the ball is in the VUK?\nBut ball save timer should not stop in the pops (some games did do this as part of all timers)\nSeems like they messed up the freeze the timers code in some states.\nBut I am seeing that the first ball of a game still has an extremely short ball save timeout - especially if you skillshot into the VUK and let the callout complete, the ball save lamp will be rapidly flashing by the time the VUK fires, giving you maybe 2 seconds of playfield ball save time. Known issue? Anyone else seeing this?\nwhat i noticed when our location Wick updated is that the actual settings on the machine didn\u2019t reset to the new longer default ball save.  if you go into settings and bump it up to 9 seconds, though, you\u2019ll see it also states that\u2019s the default setting but doesn\u2019t itself change it to that on the code update.\nThat was what my hunch was. I was just going to check that today. While I enjoy the game the early code is a bit lumpy\nHave you tried it at 9 seconds yet? I should keep my mouth shut, but 9 seconds seems crazy long for either short plunge to the VUK or to the pops. VUK is a perfect feed to the left flipper with a ski jump pass on the three examples I\u2019ve played. Bank shot off crate into VUK, rinse, repeat until mode is primed.\nPausing the timer in the pops will light lots more enemies with the timer paused. I suppose we\u2019ll see, but a bit lumpy so far sounds about right.\nWhether it\u2019s 9 seconds or something less, I\u2019m not too fussed about - the problem I\u2019m seeing is that sometimes you get the full timer and others there\u2019s barely time to get a flip in before it expires, and it\u2019s not clear why there\u2019s a difference.\nThe difference might be the number of plunge attempts before hitting a switch. I was told by an operator that the ball save will start after the 3rd fail short plunge attempt.\nI played a pro today that I believe was on older code, so I didn\u2019t pay too much attention, but I did notice a full pull all the way around the left orbit (no skill shot) seemed to give the longest ball save time. Five seconds at least\nWhile playing, I remembered reading something about the game when it was announced.\n\u2018The Stern team has created a primitive video game AI system to control the enemy lights on the playfield, setting the John Wick pinball games apart from prior pinball machines, where all lights were controlled by player actions, timers, and random number generations.\u2019\n\u2018In this new AI combat system, enemy icons are responsive to player behavior and will illuminate dynamically around the playfield to challenge the player. The enemies move tactically with this dynamic software to counter player objectives, creating a unique challenge in each game session.\u2019\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/it-s-you-versus-machine-as-stern-unveils-the-world-s-first-ai-pinball-machine/ar-BB1m1u3P\nClearly AI is controlling ball save time.\nThe funny thing is that there WERE games where AI controlled how difficult kickbacks were to relight, ie. if average game time was higher than average than it would increase the difficulty. So might not be too far off.\nYeah, I eyerolled pretty hard at that. There is no meaningful technical sense in which this is actually \u201cAI\u201d. It\u2019s not quite Peak AI Marketing Hype but it\u2019s not far off."

Crank It Up lights at the scoop after collecting 12 of eachitem+1 per Crank It Up played during the same game. Afifth Crank It Up modeawaits players who make it through all four.\nTo light the scoop forCrank It Up, 12 (+1 per subsequent mode) of the four items must be collected:\nElectric Chairs\nGrave Markers\nSnakes\nCoffins\nThere are two ways to collect the former three items - either by making direct shots to their corresponding feature on the playfield,orby shooting the corresponding insert at any of the five major shots. The inserts light by shooting their respective features, and the red spider arrow determines which shot the insert will be placed on. If all three inserts are on a single shot, the next shot made there will start aCoffin Hurry-Up. Coffins, however, can only be collected by making direct shots to the captive ball. The left inlanes light the captive ball for 2 hits for a limited time.\nCrank It Up lights at the scoop as soon as the required items have been collected and the player has returned to single-ball play, indicated by a unique sound and the 4 item inserts above the flippers pulsing.Shoot the scoop, and then choose from any of the four Crank It Up modes (that haven\u2019t been played yet) using the flipper buttons - or a relatively low value of points (5M + 1M per subsequent mode) instead of starting it.\nThe goal of each Crank It Up mode is to score as many points as possible by shooting flashing shots, then cashing them out at the scoop. These arelongmodes (averaging around 6 minutes each!), so take your time - but remember that ball save is only active for the first few seconds of the mode. A \u201ccompletion bonus\u201d is scored after making enough shots during the mode, collected right away instead of being added to the jackpot and enabling victory laps for the rest of the mode.\nDuring any Crank It Up mode, making a direct shot to each of the four main features described above will light the scoop to either collect the current jackpot value (L flipper), or continue the mode (R flipper). If the jackpot has been cashed out, the player can re-collect 25% of the jackpot value by making all five spider arrow shots, followed by the scoop to cash it out. This feature remains active until the ball drains or the next Crank It Up mode is lit bycollecting enough items.\nScoringMysteryduring any Crank It Up mode always awards \u201cCrank It Up Bonus\u201d, regardless of level. This collects the next lit shot you need for the mode and any increments that might have been awarded otherwise.\nAllside modescan be brought into and / or activated during Crank It Up.\nThe Crank It Up modes, from left to right, are as follows:\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls: The five major shots\u2019 item inserts are lit for jackpots. Make three shots to all five to score increasing jackpot values and light their inserts. Completing \u201ccolumns\u201d or \u201crows\u201d of inserts scores even higher jackpot values. Lighting all 15 inserts scores theCompletion Bonus.\nFade to Black: Switch hits add to the jackpot value, which is collected at a random flashing shot or by collecting enough switch hits. Solidly lit shots score a portion of the jackpot value. Fill the vertical progress bar on the screen through any combination of jackpots and switch hits to score theCompletion Bonus.\nBattery: Shoot Sparky over and over to score increasing amounts of points and light the electric chair inserts at other shots for jackpots. Each jackpot, either at Sparky or at other shots, increases the value of the next. Make 12 shots to Sparky to score theCompletion Bonus.\nEnter Sandman: Three randomly selected inserts on each of the five major shots will be flashing, which alternate shots witheveryswitch hit. Making any shot with a solidly lit insert scores a jackpot, which can be doubled or tripled if more than one lit insert is on that shot. Light all 15 of the inserts solid to score theCompletion Bonus.\nMultiball modes are a quick way to rack up points andcollect itemsonMetallica. There are four different multiball modes, three of which are mutually exclusive;oneadditional multiball mode can be started duringCasket Multiball.\nDuring any multiball mode, completing the four pick targets lights the Snake for a timed lock + 2x playfield for 20 seconds. Scoring the timed lock also adds a ball into play the first time it has been scored during any multiball, and activates a ball saver for about 10 seconds. Playfield scoring resets to 1x once the timer expires.\nAllside modescan be started or brought into Multiball modes and are vital to high scoring.\nSong: Creeping Death\nStarting MultiballShoot Sparky 10 times to lightelectric chair insertsat the major shots and start Electric Chair Multiball. Shots to either side of Sparky score 1 hit, while shots to the target in between them score 2 hits instead. When one shot is remaining, Sparky will taunt you and all three inserts will strobe. Shoot Sparky once more to start multiball and check out the great introduction animation & light show. Starting Electric Chair Multiball also automatically gives credit for the electric chair requirement forCrank It Up.\nSubsequent Electric Chair Multiball attempts require two more Sparky hits than the last.\nDuring MultiballFill Sparky\u2019s power meter by hitting lit jackpot shots. The jackpot shots are the flashing electric chair inserts on the left and right orbits, and the Sparky shot. The base jackpot value starts at 275k (need info on increments). Once the power meter is completely full, shoot Sparky for a 1.5M Super Jackpot that increases by 100k per Super Jackpot collected.\nEach Super Jackpot collected electrocutes one of seven Sparky characters seen on the progress bar at the bottom of the DMD display. There is a progress bar for each Sparky character. As soon as the seventh Sparky has been electrocuted, the orbits, ramps, and Sparky are all lit for super jackpots valued at a max of 2M for the remainder of the current multiball, and for every subsequent Electric Chair Multiball during the game.\nSong: Master of Puppets\nStarting MultiballEach shot to the inline drop targets increases yourbonus multiplierand lights agrave marker insertat a random shot. Once all 3 drop targets have been knocked down, shoot the grave marker target behind them to start multiball.\nSubsequent Grave Marker Multiball attempts require one more grave marker target hit than the last.\nDuring MultiballAll five major shots are lit for jackpots that start at 216k and increase with every lit grave marker shot. Shooting the grave marker target itself spots a jackpot that hasn\u2019t been collected yet (from left to right) if one isn\u2019t available there. Each jackpot also collects agrave marker.\nOnce you have made all five jackpots, the grave marker will strobe for double jackpot. Scoring the double jackpot will cause the magnet to hold the ball for 20 seconds. Each jackpot collected while the ball is held on the magnet adds to the value of the Super Jackpot that can be scored by knocking the ball off the magnet, which starts at 1M. After the Super Jackpot has been collected, the number of jackpots required to qualify subsequent double jackpots increases by 1 for the rest of the multiball.\nSong: Sad but True\nStarting MultiballShoot the Snake when lit to spot letters in SNAKE. The Snake unlights once a letter has been collected, and can be relit by shooting any shot with a litSnake insert- three of these inserts light each time you shoot the Snake. Once SNAKE has been completed, the next shot to the Snake will start 2-ball multiball.\nThe Snake must be lit once per letter for subsequent Snake Multiball attempts.\nDuring MultiballJackpots are lit at all major shots and the Snake itself. Each jackpot collected adds its value to the super jackpot, and adds a +1x multiplier to the \u201cSnake Combo\u201d, which is required to score the super jackpot. The Snake Combo value maxes at 3x.\nThe \u201cSnake Combo\u201d is collected by shooting either the left ramp or right orbit, followed by quickly shooting the Snake. Making any other shot before the Snake cancels this combo out and will require the combo to be started again. Once the Snake Combo has been collected, the multiplier will reset to 1x.\nSong: For Whom the Bell Tolls\nStarting MultiballEvery shot to the captive ball collectscoffinsand counts down towards locking a ball - virtually on the Pro, physically (via the magnet) on Prem / LE. 5 captive ball hits are required to light the first lock, and 10 hits are required to light each subsequent lock. Casket Multiball locks can not be collected while in multiball on default settings, though progress can be made towards qualifying each lock regardless. As soon as the third ball is locked, Casket Multiball begins.\nDuring MultiballCasket Multiball is unique among the multiball modes inMetallicaas it primarily serves as a vehicle for bringing in one additionalmultiball modeand as manyside modesas you can. The only jackpots available during this multiball are scored by alternating between the flashing red arrows and the captive ball. Collecting 5 captive ball jackpots scores a Super Jackpot in place of the normal jackpot value, worth the total of the prior collected jackpots.\nExperiment with figuring out which modes and multiballs to start during Casket Multiball.Seek & Destroyis a very good contender for stacking as the mode uses the same shot pattern as Casket Multiball.\nSide modes can be started atany time, even while other features likeCrank It Upormultiball modesare running. Many side modes have ways to extend their timers, allowing them to potentially last for much longer than their initial 45 second timers.\nShoot the FUEL targets four times to add to the FUEL gauge, displayed in the center of the playfield, and light the dead end target behind them for2x Playfield. Once the FUEL gauge is completely full (after three completions of FUEL for the first attempt), the next shot to any of the targets will start the FUEL frenzy.\nThis frenzy mode allows the player to rack up points that can be cashed out potentially endlessly. Every switch hit scores 10k and adds to the jackpot value, while direct shots to the FUEL targets add more time to the mode and light the jackpot at the dead end target (which caps at 500k). The frenzy ends when the player\u2019s FUEL gauge runs out, though there is a lengthy grace period to keep it running.\nFurther FUEL frenzies during the same game require one additional completion of the FUEL targets to qualify.\nEvery shot to the left and right ramps scores a letter in METALLICA. Once the word has been completed with 9 shots, shoot either ramp again to begin Lady Justice. METALLICA letters can also be scored from randommystery awards.\nThe goal of Lady Justice is to attempt to \u201cbalance the scales\u201d by alternating shots between the left and right sides of the playfield. The value for the next shot on either side of the playfield is displayed on the DMD, starting at 500k and increases by 25k for each shot made there - which seems small, but as the mode can go on for a while, this can become very lucrative. Alternating shots between both sides of the playfield scores 2x the currently displayed value and increasesbothvalues by 50k instead of 25k. The orbit up-post is disabled during this mode.\nMaking any shot if the timer is under 15 seconds resets the timer to that value.\nSeek & Destroy starts as soon as all fiveCoffin Hurry-Upshave been collected at the captive ball. These are started by lighting all threeitemsat any of the five major shots, then shooting the shot with the strobing inserts. They can also be automatically qualified through one of thesuper skill shots. Hurry-ups start at 1.5M and increase if multiple hurry-ups are active at once.\nSeek & Destroy is a potentially lucrative mode that can last a long time if you keep making the required shots. One randomly determined shot is lit to \u201cseek\u201d and score a jackpot, while the remaining shots are solidly lit to score mini jackpots worth 50% of the jackpot value. Once the required shot has been made, shoot the captive ball to \u201cdestroy\u201d and score a super jackpot worth double the jackpot value. Rinse and repeat until the timer runs out (making required shots resets the timer to 15 seconds if needed).\nThis mode is started by collecting all 4 band members by hitting the 4 pick targets. Each activation of the snake add-a-ball during anymultiball modecounts as a completion of the pick targets, and one additional pick target completion is required for each member. This means 10 pick target completions for your first Blackened, then 14 for your second, etc.\nDuring Blackened, the pick targets must be completed to light the shots for points starting at 1M; each target shot scores 250K + some small increment for each target hit, and adds itself to the shot value. If either multiplier is running (snake add-a-ball or2x Playfield), the multiplied target value will be added to the shot value. Each collected shot resets the timer to 15 seconds if needed.\nEvery completion of theFUEL targetslights the dead end target for 2x playfield for 20 seconds. This multiplier is additive with the 2x playfield from thesnake add-a-ball, meaning 4x scoring is possible during all multiball modes with both playfield multipliers active.\nThe dead end target typically awards 250k + a small bonus for any lit circles at the lane in front of the target. These circle inserts are lit by completing enough pop bumpers.\nEnding acomboat the dead end target will award one Blown Piston for each circle lit via the pop bumpers. Each Blown Piston is worth double the normal bonus for shooting the target, and collecting 10 Blown Pistons will light anextra ball.\nShooting shots that flow into each other consecutively without missing will award combos.Extra Ballis lit after shooting 15, then 50 combos. Combos can also be ended at the dead end target to awardBlown Pistons.\nComplete all 5 rollover lanes (3 inlanes, 2 above pop bumpers), which alternate with the flippers, to light Mystery at the scoop. Complete them multiple times for better awards, up to level 4. Shoot scoop when Mystery is lit to collect a random award (from the following set: small points, light 1 or 2items,SNAKE letters,METALLICA letter,bonus X). The mystery animation can be skipped by pressing both flippers.\nDuringCrank It Up modes, Mystery always awards \u201cCrank It Up Bonus\u201d, worth the value of the next required shot and any associated bonuses. The mystery level does not effect this award.\nShooting the captive ball 10, then 40, 70, etc. times ((+/- depending on settings)\n15, then 50Combos\n10Blown Pistons\nIf the extra ball cap has been reached, each extra ball scores 2.5M.\nSpecial can be lit at either outlane, alternating with slingshot hits, by collecting threeband members. Special is worth a replay on default settings but can score other operator-adjustable awards.\nBonus is determined by calculating the number ofitemsthe player has collected over the course of the game, multiplied by the bonus X (which increases with shots to theinline drop targets). Bonus can be fairly large during a long game.\nOnce all 4Crank It Upmodes have beenplayed(they don\u2019t need to be completed or cashed out), collect enoughitemsto light the 5th Crank It Up mode and shoot the scoop to startEnd of the Line.This nearly 8 minute long track has the potential to turn your good game into an outstanding game, as long as you\u2019ve done well during your Crank It Up modes and play the wizard mode out well.\nAt the start of End of the Line, you receive a hefty bonus for all the items you\u2019ve collected in the game. This seems to be 200k per # of items collected throughout your game.\nThis wizard mode starts with 2 balls in play and 1 random shot lit for a jackpot. Collect the jackpot to light a roving Super Jackpot (from left to right, and then back). Once you collect the Super Jackpot, an add-a-ball plus ball-save is awarded and you return to the jackpot phase, but with one additional shot required to qualify your next Super Jackpot. You can repeat this cycle until you complete it, with all 6 shots lit for jackpots. After the final Super Jackpot, all shots award jackpots and no additional Super Jackpots are possible.\nThe Super Jackpot value is determined by the cumulative total of the Crank It Up modes you played, awarded in the same order that you played the modes in (ie. if you playedFor Whom the Bell Tollsfirst, andFade to Blacksecond, then your 2nd End of the Line Super Jackpot = both of those mode totals. The 5th and 6th Super Jackpots \u201cwrap around\u201d your CIU mode totals in the Super Jackpot formula, so you\u2019ll get 2x your 1st mode and 2x your 2nd mode total added in, respectively. BothFuel 2x PlayfieldandSnake 2x Playfieldare in play during this multiball, so you can 2x or even 4x these Super Jackpot values!\nIf you drain down to single-ball play during End of the Line, the scoop can be lit for the final collect the same way that it can during the other Crank It Up modes (and it can also be qualified by completing the four features during the multiball). The final collect, with all 6 Super Jackpots collected, is often worth over 1B (!!!) points on its own, and - of course - can be doubled viaFuel 2x Playfield. Scoring the final collect ends the mode and returns to normal play.\nAfter playing End of the Line, play returns to normal and no further Crank It Up modes can be played for the remainder of the game - qualifying subsequent Crank It Up modes simply locks the player into scoring 10M. However, until the player qualifies Crank It Up again, they can continue to cash out 25% of the final collect for the remainder of the ball.\nawesome!\nYes I would love to know how to get a snake multiball super\n-Also for the combo jackpot, I think it starts at 500k and goes up 250k every time (same ball)\n-would love to read more about the blackened mode.  I was in it once, and it felt like it was its own crank it up mode in which I was stuck in it.  The crank it up light was lit for some sort of collect, and it would extend the timer.\n-For the \u2018and justice for all\u2019 mode, I believe if you do shots on alternating sides of the playfield you\u2019ll get higher value in the shots. (600k vs 300k maybe)\n-as i found out on here earlier, once you have completed seek and destroy, all of the lit items become unlit and you have to complete them again to get items.\nIts a wiki, feel free to edit it!\nOOPS I\u2019m new Greg\nUpdated stacking section\nAdded a bunch of detail to CIU modes, Snake inserts, and a nugget about Lady Justice mode.\nSeek and DestroyCAN be stacked withBlackenedas i have done this several times.\nToday I learned that the fuel target is one long target. My life is a lie.\nLet this thread\u2026 Live again! (briefly)\nNoticed that most pro versions do not lock the ball in the snake as it should during multiball 2x scoring, even though the DMD says it should be locked. The Premium/LE version seems to lock the ball in the snake.\nIs it meant to be that way in the pro version which means that the DMD is sending out wrong information, or is it a bug in the game code for the pro version?\nNoticed that most pro versions do not lock the ball in the snake as it should during multiball 2x scoring, even though the DMD says it should be locked.

Not sure why it should default to different behavior than the Premium, but there ya go.\nAhh\u2026 explains it then, thanks\nNot sure why it should default to different behavior than the Premium, but there ya go.\nI believe it\u2019s to cater to operators, to prevent the accidental two balls getting jammed in the snake on the Pro on location. Vs the Prem/LE where the snake jaw can close, blocking off another ball from getting stuck with the first.\nAs mentioned, if a Pro is in your home or at a location with active Tech help to free stuck balls, then set the Pro to the intended MET design of locking the ball in the snake. It certainly adds to the enjoyment of the game.\nAnd thankfully MET\u2019s during-Multiball ball lock is much more difficult to qualify and execute than the ridiculously easy and overpowering Groot 2x/3x Locks.\nHey, while this thread is briefly resurfaced. Can someone explain the \u201csnake combo\u201d that appears on the DMD during snake multi ball? I see it say things like \u201cSnake combo at 2x\u201d, but haven\u2019t gotten a chance to confirm what that actually means.\nCan someone explain the \u201csnake combo\u201d that appears on the DMD during snake multi ball? I see it say things like \u201cSnake combo at 2x\u201d, but haven\u2019t gotten a chance to confirm what that actually means.\nFrom theREADMEfor v1.2:\nEach snake icon shot on the playfield starts a snake combo which can be collected at the snake.     The first shot lights the snake for 2x the value, the second shot lights the snake for 3x the value, etc.  Once the combo value is collected at the snake, the combo is stopped and the next snake shot will start the combo multiplier at 3x.  The multiplier is capped at 5x.\nAlso from theREADMEfor v1.7:After collecting 3  (adjustable) snake combo jackpots, all shots are lit for super jackpot  until the end of the multiball.\nEnding a combo in the FUEL lane will award a blown piston if the appropriate pop bumper hits have been completed.10 blown pistons lights extra ball.\nIf I have all three lights lit up at the fuel lane and end a combo there, do I get three blown pistons?\nIf I have all three lights lit up at the fuel lane and end a combo there, do I get three blown pistons?\nYoushouldbut there is a bug where you do not. You always get just 1 blown piston no matter how many lights are lit / flashing. I asked Lyman about it and he said, \u201cI thought I fixed that. I will look into that bug again.\u201d\nBummer, but good to know. Thanks!\nCoffin MultiballLocks can not be collected while in multiball on default settings. However, captive ball hits do count towards next lock if the lock is not lit.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the premium/le vs pro here. I think I noticed in a couple video recordings (including@sk8ball\u2019s) that the premium/le captive ball hit count behaves differently than on the pro?\nIs it this? On pro, the captive ball counter can be advanced during MBs, but lock can\u2019t be collected. The hits that count toward building lock seem top stop counting up while it is lit for lock, and can\u2019t be advanced further till that lock is collected (out of MB)?\nThen on the premium, the hits can build past the lock point so that you can feasibly lock 1 ball, then hit the captive again and lock another if you\u2019ve advanced that far?\nThen on the premium, the hits can build past the lock point so that you can feasibly lock 1 ball, then hit the captive again and lock another if you\u2019ve advanced that far?\nBy default, Pre and Pro work the same. You can advance to where a lock is ready but not collected.\nThere\u2019s a setting in the Pre that allows you to collect locks. Not sure that this setting is in the Pro. [And that\u2019s really weird, given that I own a Pro and not a Pre.)"

        "https://rules.silverballmania.com/rules/G5b38-MDqkx": "Meteor SS - Stern | 1979\nQuickie Version:\nKnock down the M, R and all but one of the E-T-E-O Meteor letter targets, then shoot the spinner all day. Whenever you complete Meteor and the targets reset, get them again, then back to the spinner.\nGo-to Flipper:\nLeft\nRisk Index:\nHigh; watch out for around-the-world spinner drains in either direction\nFull Rules:\nThis is one of the more spinner-heavy games you\u2019ll ever find. The spinner is worth 200 points plus 200 per letter target down in Meteor for the letters E-T-E-O and 600 extra for the M and the R. If you have M-E-T-O-R, for instance, you get 200+600+200+200+200+600 or 2,000 per spin! Finishing all six letters resets the Meteor letter drop target bank and reduces the spinner value back to 200. Each time you complete Meteor, you also raise your bonus X by one up to a max of 7X. Bonus is built from the numbered target banks, 1, 2 and 3, 1000 for each target up to 7 total. Completing a numbered target bank also awards the current value of that bank, i.e. how high your bonus for that number is (unmultiplied). Maximum end of ball bonus is 147K (1000*7*3*7), but whenever your ending bonus multiplier is 6X or 7X, it resets to single bonus for the next ball. For 1X to 5X, the multiplier is held. Meteor targets downed during a ball are remembered, while the 1-2-3 banks all reset each ball. My general strategy is UTAD: spinner from the left flipper, with the occasional center shot for the \u201cR\u201d in Meteor when the spinner value is low; bank shot off the #2 drop targets from the right flipper. I don\u2019t worry about accidentally completing the Meteor letters, even if I have the optimal five lit, for three reasons. First, it\u2019s pretty easy to knock them down again to get your spinner back up close to its maximum. Second, the Meteor targets themselves are good value - - 2000 each for E-T-E-O and 6000 each for the M and the R, or a total of 20K per set. Third, that bonus multiplier advance I mentioned earlier. The lit return lanes spot a Meteor letter, too, so you\u2019ll often finish the set by accident when the ball goes through there. The lanes present an opportunity for strategic shatzing: if you have 3 or 4 letters and the ball cradled on the right flipper, you can try shatzing the ball to the left flipper. This will both set up a spinner shot and potentially collect another letter or two, increasing your spinner value if your alley pass goes up far enough to trip the return lane switch. Just don\u2019t shatz too hard, you can get an up-the-inlane, down-the-outlane drain. As for the 1 and 3 banks, I ignore them, since you\u2019ll collect some by accident making saves or via slingshot bounces. I\u2019ll shoot for the number 2 bank at the upper left if the ball is coming down the right return lane too fast to trap but too slowly to pass it to the left flipper. That will both add bonus and get the ball up near the Meteor letters; you\u2019ll usually want to nudge one way or another after the ball bounces off the #2 targets to try to get it to deflect towards the Meteor letters or the top of the bumper below them. If I have the ball cradled on the right flipper and the letters I need up top are the middle ones, I\u2019ll sometimes shoot to thread the ball between the bumper and the upper flipper. That shot is riskier, though, since a miss can hit either the bumper or the post below the upper flipper and rebound downwards toward draining. Observe that the gap to the left of the bumper is much wider than to the right, making that the outside shot the easier route to the top from the right flipper. Meteor is a great game for practicing ball transfer techniques, since it\u2019s so important to get the ball on the left flipper. Plus the sound of a good spinner rip is really satisfying.\nPinVideosMatch Play*youtubeOPDBIPDBFlyer*\nMeteor SS - Stern | 1979\nShortname: MET\nPlayers: 4\nDisplay: alphanumeric"

        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/monsterbash_Gr3EW.html": "Monster Bash is all about stacking modes. Starting each mode typically takes between 3 and 7 shots to a certain feature. Modes are timed, so try to start a handful of them all at once, but leave Frankenstein Multiball or Mosh Pit Multiball for last, since modes can be carried into multiball and all timers pause when more than one ball is in play. The center shot with the spinner lights Mosh Pit Multiball and awards smart bombs. Start all 6 modes for mini-wizard mode, complete all 6 modes for full wizard mode.\nOne of the three top lanes that spell D-I-G will be flashing. The flashing lane can be moved in either direction with lane change. If the plunged ball goes through this lane, you score 100,000 points and a random monster weapon. Subsequent skill shots score 50,000 more than the previous. If there is a maximum, it is at least 250,000.\nCompleting D-I-G increases the bonus multiplier by 1x and increases the pop bumper value by 1,500 points (they start at 10,000 at the beginning of the game). If there is a maximum point value for the bumpers, it is at least 25,000 per hit. The maximum bonus multiplier is 250x.\nEach monster has a playfield feature and a mode. Shooting a monster's feature enough times, typically to complete a selection of lights somewhere on the playfield, starts that monster's mode, and lights that monster's face on the playfield. All six monster modes can be completed in some way; doing so lights the instrument on the playfield corresponding to that monster. Collecting the 6 monsters by starting all of their modes lights the scoop for Monster Bash, a mini wizard mode. Collecting all 6 instruments by completing all of their modes lights the scoop for Monsters of Rock, the full wizard mode.\nIn the order they are shown on the playfield from left to right, the monsters are:\nCreature from the Black Lagoon:a small cave-like lane, somewhat detached from the rest of the playfield on the far left. Making the lane 4 times to finish the lights above the cave starts Creature Feature. During Creature Feature, the goal is to hit all 5 major shots in the game- both orbits, both ramps, and the center lane. You have 20 seconds to make a shot, and making any lit shot resets the timer. The first lit shot scores 1,000,000 points, and each additional lit shot score 1,000,000 more than the last, with the final shot being worth 5,000,000. Shooting the Creature's cave spots one of the remaining shots for you. Making all 5 lit shots awards the Creature's saxophone.\nBride of Frankenstein:corresponds to the two ramps. Each ramp needs three shots to complete: those three shots score 200,000, 225,000, and 250,000 each. Making a completed ramp scores 300,000. Compelting both ramps starts Ball and Chain, the Bride's mode. The goal in Ball and Chain is to complete both ramps again (three shots each) within 30 seconds. The timer does not reset when you make a ramp, but it can be reset up to 3 separate times by shooting the center spinner lane. Ramps score 1,000,000 points each during this mode, and the center spinner lane scores 500,000. Completing all three shots on both ramps within the time limit awards the Bride's microphone. The mode keeps going after the microphone is collected, though, with ramps worth 1,500,000 each until the timer runs out.\nFrankenstein's Monster:the standup targets just left of center on the playfield. Shooting either target a total of 7 times causes the Frankenstein toy to tilt backwards and reveal a ramp; shooting this ramp starts Frankenstein Multiball. This is a three-ball multiball where the goal is to bash the Frankenstein toy 7 more times. Hitting the toy scores a 1,000,000 point super jackpot; all other shots in the game score a 400,000 point regular jackpot. Making two or three regular jackpots with no super jackpot in between will double or triple the next super jackpot respectively, increasing its value to 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 and counting has 2 or 3 separate super jackpots toward mode completion. Collecting a total of 7 super jackpots awards Frankenstein's keyboard. If the multiball ends without collecting the keyboard, the ramp behind Frankenstein will still be available for 15 seconds; shoot this to start Last Chance, a single-ball mode with all the other rules of Frankenstein Multiball that ends once the keyboard is collected or once 15 seconds pass without hitting Frankenstein himself.Since all timers stop during any multiball on this game, and since other modes can be brought into multiball but not started during multiball, always try to start Frankenstein last so that everything is in play for high value for as long as possible.\nMummy Mayhem:is started at the scoop, and is lit by hitting a total of 60 pop bumpers. The goal of Mummy Mayhem is simply to score 7,500,000 points within 45 seconds. During Mummy Mayhem, all major shots in the game (Creature, both loops, both ramps, and the center lane) score a Mummy Jackpot that is worth 500,000 points plus an additional 50,000 points for each switch hit since the last Mummy Jackpot was recorded. Collecting 7,500,000 points lights the Mummy's bass guitar, and gives an award equal to 250,000 points times the number of seconds left on the clock when you reached the scoring threshold. Each time Mummy Mayhem is completed, the next trip to Mummy Mayhem will require 10 more pop bumper hits to light, and 500,000 more points to complete.\nThe Wolfman:corresponds to the loops. Shooting either loop advances the moon phase through Quarter, Half, Three Quarter, and Full Moon. That fourth shot which awards Full Moon starts Full Moon Fever, the Wolfman's mode. Full Moon Fever is a true hurry-up, where each shot starts at an increasing value (1 million, then 2, then 3, then 4) and counts down until it is hit. The value will go as low as 250,000, then stay there for a few seconds, then time out and end the mode. Collecting all 4 hurry-ups awards the Wolfman's drum kit.Take note: when Full Moon Fever is not running, shots to either orbit will be diverted into the pop bumpers, but if Fever is running, shots will go all the way around the back of the game and must come down the opposite orbit to count (unless Mummy Mayhem is running, in which case the ball will go into the pops anyway but orbit credits are still given).\nDracula:the right side standup targets. Hitting either one spots a letter in Dracula, and completing the word lights Drac-Attack at the scoop. Completing Dracula again before starting the mode at the scoop awards a garlic clove, which is Dracula's weapon. During Drac-Attack, a Dracula toy will slide around the right side of the playfield in an arc. The goal is to hit Dracula a total of 5 times. Hits to Dracula score 1,250,000 points if Dracula is not moving, or 2,500,000 if he is moving. 5 hits to Dracula lights his lead guitar.\nLighting 3 monsters by starting their modes lights an extra ball at the scoop. Lighting 4 instruments by completing their modes will light the out lanes alternately for a special.\nEach of the six monsters has their own Weapon, which can be collected either at the skill shot or by making the center lane a multiple of 3 times. Weapons are used during their modes by pressing the Launch button. The Weapons act like smart bombs, and spot one shot toward completing that mode. If you have Weapons for multiple monsters whose modes are running concurrently, the used Weapon will be whichever monster is closer to completing their mode. The weapons are:\nCreature from the Black Lagoon: spear gun. Spots the leftmost shot that is still needed for Creature Feature.\nBride of Frankenstein: hair dryer. Spots a ramp shot, alternating sides (right first) unless one is completed.\nFrankenstein's monster: flaming torch. Spots one hit to the Frankenstein toy during his multiball or Last Chance.\nThe Mummy: ancient scroll. Scores one Mummy Jackpot.\nThe Wolfman: silver bullet. Scores one Full Moon Fever hurry-up, and instantly starts the next one.\nDracula: garlic clove. Spots 1 hit on Dracula during Drac-Attack. Using a garlic clove while he is moving does still give the double value.\nThe center spinner scores points (I haven't figured out exactly how many, seems to be variable). During single ball play when no mode is running, a shot up the center lane that goes around the back of the game and down the left orbit scores one Mosh Pit. The 6th Mosh Pit, and every 18th after that (24th, 42nd, 60th, etc), lights the scoop for Mosh Pit Multiball. The 12th and 30th Mosh Pits light the scoop for extra ball. All other multiples of 3 Mosh Pits award a random monster weapon. It is quite a bit easier to shoot this lane from the right flipper.\nMosh Pit Multiball is started at the scoop. Initially, it is a 2-ball multiball, with a jackpot that starts at 750,000 points. Any switch in the game (except the pop bumpers?) increases the mosh pit jackpot by 5,000 points. Any major shot in the game (both orbits, both ramps, Creature, center mosh pit lane) scores the mosh pit jackpot, but does not reset its value, unlike the Mummy Jackpot. The center mosh pit lane also adds a ball to the multiball on each of the first two hits, making mosh pit effectively a 4-ball mode. During Mosh Pit Multiball, the ramp behind Frankenstein's monster is revealed. Shooting it 10 times scores a super jackpot worth 10x the current mosh jackpot value. Then, the targets will raise, and hitting them a further 5 times scores a second super jackpot, this time worth only 3x the current mosh jackpot. These super jackpots alternate in their availability for the duration of the multiball.\nA semi-obscured standup between the center lane and the scoop. Most attempts to shoot the center lane with the left flipper end up here. It's a rather dangerous target that sends the ball back at the flippers quite quickly. The target scores +1 bonus multiplier and 10x the current pop bumper value, but does not actually spot 10 bumpers toward the next Mummy Mayhem.\nHitting any of the blue targets on either side of the left ramp or on either side of Frankenstein's shot awards a letter in the word Phantom. Spelling Phantom lights two phantom flips, which alternate between the in lanes and can be moved with either flipper lane change. If a ball goes through a lit in lane, the game will take control of that flipper and flip for you, aiming at whatever shot on the opposite side of the table it thinks you need the most. Supposedly, the game adjusts the timing of Phantom Flip after missed shots to calibrate to specific machines, but even with this, it tends to brick shots and put balls out of contorl more often than not.\nNo matter what it's lit for, the scoop awards a Concert Hall before anything else. This is a minor mystery award that comes alongside the name of a real-life concert venue, typically altered a bit to make a horror themed pun. The most common awards are 50,000 points, 75,000 points, 100,000 points, one of the monster weapons, advance a monster (toward mode start), or Hold Bonus X. However, the scoop can also give Light Extra Ball if the first two balls were particularly short in length, or it can start one of the monster modes for you (most often done when 5 monsters or 5 instruments have been collected).The 44th scoop shot will always award Lyman's Lament. This is a secret easter egg mode that lasts for the remainder of the ball: you get +25 bonus X, the value of each switch in the game toward bonus is increased to 2,500, and Lyman Sheats himself (the game's software designer) will comment and taunt you on your ball.\nThe scoop can also be lit for Start Mummy Mayhem, Start Drac-Attack, Extra Ball, Monster Bash, and Monsters of Rock.\nLit at the scoop by playing, but not completing, all 6 monsters' modes. This is more similar to Total Annihilation in Attack From Mars or Royal Madness from Medieval Madness than a true wizard mode. It's a 4-ball multiball with a fairly long ball save. Any monster's shot scores 2,000,000 points. The center mosh pit shot scores a Bash Jackpot of 2,000,000 points plus an additional 500,000 points for every monster shot hit since the last Bash Jackpot, up to a maximum of 7,500,000 points.\nThis is lit at the scoop by collecting all 6 of the monsters' instruments (completing all of their modes). Just starting Monsters of Rock gives a mega bonus of 5,000,000 points per instrument collected over the entire game so far (including duplicates) plus 25,000,000 points for each completed set of instruments earned to that point. This means that Monsters of Rock is guaranteed to have a 55,000,000 startup bonus the first time, 110,000,000 startup bonus the second time, etc. On top of all of that, if you're playing Monsters of Rock without ever having started Monster Bash (usually done by completing all 6 modes the first time through, and not having Mummy or Dracula be the last one), you get an additional 50,000,000 points Rock-before-Bash bonus.\nDuring the multiball itself, all monster shots score 4,000,000 points each. Bashing any monster lights their face on the playfield. Making a complete set by bashing all 6 monsters at least once scores a Monsters of Rock collection bonus of 4,000,000 points for each monster shot hit since the last collection bonus. The center mosh pit lane scores and spots a monster toward the collection bonus for you. A good Monsters of Rock should score several hundred million points.\nModes can be brought into Monster Bash, the mini wizard mode. If modes are completed during Bash that give the player a complete instrument set, Rock will immediately start, with all the benefits therein, including restarting the 4-ball multiball and firing up a new ball save. Modes cannot be brought into Monsters of Rock.\nMonster Bash has a conventional in/out lane setup. The out lanes are lit alternately for a special after collecting 4 monster instruments. The in lanes are lit alternately via lane change after spelling Phantom to light Phantom Flip as described above.\nBase bonus is equal to 50,000 points, plus an additional 370 points for every switch hit over the course of the entire ball (unless Lyman's Lament is started, in which case switch hits after Lament starts at 2,500 to the bonus instead of 370). I am not aware of a maximum base bonus count. Bonus is not carried over from ball to ball.Bonus multiplier is advanced by 1 for each completion of the D-I-G lanes and each hit to the Tomb Treasure target. It is also advanced by 25 by starting Lyman's Lament. Max bonus multiplier is 250x. Bonus multiplier is not carried over from ball to ball unless a Hold Bonus X was collected from a mystery concert hall.\nExtra balls and specials cannot be set to have a point value for competition/novelty play.\nThe length of the ball save, and how many times the ball save can be used over the course of a game before it does not come on anymore, can be set individually.\nThe timer for all monster modes except Wolfman can be set. Most modes have a range of 20-40 or 30-60 seconds on their time limits.\nThe game can start with some Dracula letters (default 3) or some Frankenstein body parts (default off) lit to make it easier to collect those instruments the first time.\nThe extra balls available from the mosh pit lane can be set to 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, or off for the first, and 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, or off for the second.\nThe number of monsters or instruments needed to light the extra ball or special can each be set to anywhere from 1-6.\nPhantom Flip can be set to have a short ball save activate whenever the Phantom Flip fires, or alternatively, the whole phantom feature can be disabled outright."

        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/mousinaround_G43oq.html": "The left ramp, right ramp, and right lane give Cheese letters: the right ramp can be comboed. Spell Cheese to light the right ramp for a mystery award and a jackpot advance. Once the jackpot is high, finish the Mouse Trap standup targets and lock both balls for multiball. During multiball, hit both lock shots again to light jackpot on the right ramp.\nOn the plunge, one of the three top lanes will be flashing. The flashing lane cannot be moved with lane change. Making a skill shot into the flashing lane scores 100,000 points multiplied by the current ball number, as well as instantly advancing the jackpot value.At any other time in the game, going through a top lane lights it, the lights can be moved with lane change, and lighting all 3 lanes advances the bonus multiplier to 2x or 3x. It's very rare for the ball to end up in these top lanes; when it does happen, it's almost always due to pop bumper luck, so don't rely on multiplying bonus as a strategy. End of ball bonus isn't worth a ton of points in the grand scheme of things anyway.\nThe 5 standup targets on the left spell Mouse, and the four on the right spell Trap. Each target scores 5,000 points. Completing both Mouse and Trap lights the locks on the left orbit and right lane. Letters in Mouse and Trap can also be spotted by lit in lanes.\nValue of this shot starts at 50,000 points. Making the orbit scores the value and increases it by 50,000. When worth 200,000 points, this orbit also lights extra ball on both ramps. The catch to all these points is that the orbit must be comboed: shooting the left orbit feeds the ball to the right flipper, and if the orbit is not made again within 5 seconds, the shot value resets all the wya back to the base 50,000.\nWhen locks are lit (\"traps are set\"), this left orbit is one of the lock shots. Shots made to the left orbit when lock is lit cannot count for the progressive big loop award.\nWhenever the retractable targets are up, making 1-2-3 in order will lower them, revealing the center ramp. Making the center ramp scores 100,000 points and lights the left and right ramps for Million Advance. Also, completing the 1-2-3 targets or making the center ramp 3 times will relight the left out lane kickback if it was not already on.\nThe left ramp, right ramp, and right lane are almost always lit for Cheese. Each letter in Cheese scores an increasing value from 10,000 to 50,000 points. When Cheese is spelled, the Mouse Hole is open on the right ramp. Making the Mouse Hole awards the Cheezy Bonus, which is a mystery award that can give Special, Extra Ball, 1,000,000 points, or a random award between 100,000 and 500,000 in multiples of 50,000. Collecting a Cheezy Bonus also increases the value of the multiball jackpot, which starts at 1,000,000 points at the beginning of the game for each player; jackpot advances increase the jackpot by 500,000, up to a maximum of 4,000,000 points. Collecting a jackpot resets its value. Unlike some other games from this time, jackpot is not shared between players or across games.\nOnce 1-2-3 on the center targets has been completed in order and the center ramp has been shot once, the left and right ramps will both light for Million Letter. From here, either ramp awards a letter in Million. Make 7 ramp shots to spell Million and the Mouse Hole will open on the right ramp for a 1,000,000 point shot. This shot is not timed, and once the Million Letter lamps or the Million Shot are lit they will typically stay on until collected, even across balls.\nThe target at the end of the right lane shot spots a Cheese letter (see above). When locks are lit by spelling Mouse Trap, the right lock is in this lane. There is one other feature, though; if the right ramp is made twice in a row consecutively without any other switches being hit in between, this lane will light for Double Scoring for a few seconds. Shooting the target in the right lane while Double Scoring is lit starts 2x playfield scoring, which runs for 15 seconds. This is a good time to hit as many ramps and left orbits as you can.\nSpelling Mouse Trap lights the locks at the left orbit and right lane. Making both locks starts multiball. There is no playfield multiplier during multiball; everything is in play for normal scoring, with the locks lit. When a ball is shot into either lock, it will stay there for a couple seconds and be kicked back out; doing this causes the Set Trap insert to go from flashing to solidly lit. Shooting both locks lights the right ramp Mouse Hole for Jackpot for 15 seconds. Collecting the jackpot causes its value to return to the base 1,000,000 points, but multiple jackpots can be collected in a single multiball (and the value can even be re-raised by ramp shots before hitting the locks again, too). Failing to collect the jackpot means both locks must be shot again for another chance. If the game returns to single ball play while the jackpot timer is running, it will continue to run until the jackpot is made, the time runs out, or the ball is drained.\nBonus is advanced by pretty much any shot in the game (ramps, loops, lanes, targets). I have not yet made a specific distribution of exactly what shots award how much bonus. Bonus is generally carried over from ball to ball, and seems to be in the 150,000-250,000 range at the end of a typical three ball game. It's not much in the grand scheme of things, but I do still recommend trying not to tilt on ball 3 because games on Mousin Around can frequently be decided by a quarter million points or less.2x and 3x bonus can be achieved by completing the top lanes once or twice in a single ball. This is very difficult and rare, so don't rely on it as a strategy; if your ball was going on long enough to actually get the 3x bonus, it was probably long enough for you to pick up other more lucrative scoring, such as a couple Cheezy Bonuses or a Jackpot.\nMousin' Around has a conventional in/out lane setup with a center peg between the flippers. The left out lane has a kickback that is on at the start of each ball and an be relit by completing the center 1-2-3 targets in order, or making 3 shots to the exposed center ramp. Both out lanes can be lit for 250,000 points by making the left loop.The in lanes will both be lit for Spot Mouse Trap Letter until a multiball has been played; for the second multiball and on, only one in lane will be lit at a time.\nThe kickback can be set to be on to start every ball, on at the start of the game with memory, off at the start of the game with memory, or off to start every ball.The in lanes can both always be on, always have only one on, always be both off, or function as described above where both are on for the first multiball and only one is on for subsequent multiballs.The Million Letter lights on the ramps can be on to start the game, or they can turn off after each individual Million letter, requiring another center ramp shot to relight.Cheese letters are carried from ball to ball by default, but this can be turned off.The end of ball bonus can be reset between balls instead of carrying over.The Double Playfield timer and the Jackpot timer can both be set to any time from 0 to 30 seconds; both default to 15.The timer on the left orbit's value resetting can be anywhere from 1 to 5 seconds. Also, the loop can start at 150,000 or 100,000 instead of 50,000; or, it can require two or three 50,000 shots before advancing to 100,000. In other words, the extra ball can be set to require 2, 3, 4 (default), 5, or 6 comboed left orbit shots.The operator has control over how frequently the Cheezy Bonus gives extra balls and specials. Both can be disabled outright. I am not aware of any ability to set extra balls and specials to be worth points for competition/novelty play."

Shoot the spinner on the left to advance it, collect it at the center saucer. If the ball is on the left flipper and you have little bonus, you can shoot the drops or saucer in the upper right for points. If the kickout from the saucer comes clean to the right flipper, though, either by cradle dead bounce or live catch, you can shoot the saucer as a ball transfer. Then shoot the left spinner. Once the saucer value is high enough, just repeat saucer shots as much as you can, using whichever technique [dead bounce, catch, trap] works best to set up a repeat shot. This is a great game for patience and for practicing dead bounces. Many bounces will end up dropping towards a flipper, and dead bouncing is most often the best way to get control. Most Old Chicagos play slow, too, other than when the ball is in the bumpers. Speaking of ball in the bumpers, if your bumpers are reasonably active, don\u2019t worry overmuch about shaking the game while the ball is in them; it doesn\u2019t drain through the lanes below them as often as you\u2019d think unless the bumpers are weak.\nPinVideosMatch Play*youtubeOPDBIPDBFlyer*\nOld Chicago EM - Bally | 1976\nShortname: OC\nPlayers: 4\nDisplay: reels",

Be careful holding a flipper up to get control, as the ball can sometimes bounce \"backwards\" and end up in danger of falling down an out lane. Dead bounces usually deflect into the small vertical wall next to the opposite flipper, but raising the flipper to get control out of this needs to be done carefully lest the ball get completely flipped away.\nTry to avoid the lower 10 point bumpers at any cost. If the ball gets stuck below a bumper or between a bumper and the corresponding outer wall, it'll end up getting spiked down the out lane surprisingly often.\nIf the ball is rolling down the rail toward the out lane, a well timed up nudge can usually pop the ball over the lane. Be mindful of the strength of this, though, as you really don't want to tilt on this game, especially on a double bonus ball.\nBonus maxes out at 10,000 points. There is no way to rebuild, extend, or hold the bonus, so just whack the ball into the center collect scoop as many times as possible.\nDouble bonus cannot be earned; it can only be given for free on certain ball numbers based on settings.

Lighting the yellow saucer is next best. The top red rollover button switches which color\u2019s lane is lit and adds a bonus, as does the lower center red button. You want to hit the button, or not, just enough times to ensure that green is lit when the ball enters the center lane. The top advance bonus lanes are synched to the light-saucer colors; when the center is lit for yellow, the top right advance is lit, when the center is on green, the top left advance is lit.\nFull Rules:\nBuilding and collecting bonus is the route. Bonus builds from the top left and right lanes when lit, the stand-up target below the left lane and the chute through the gate at the upper right. Shooting the three red drop targets once for R-A-N gives you double bonus and lights the spinner on the left for 1K.

Don\u2019t bother shooting at the yellow one, only the green one via the spinner. The top right chute scores a bonus advance plus one more advance for each lit color. Since the chute also ejects the ball to the top to score a top lane for another potential advance or to light the other color saucer, that\u2019s the best play when the spinner is not lit.\nPinVideosMatch Play*youtubeOPDBIPDBFlyer*\nRancho EM - Williams | 1977\nPlayers: 2\nDisplay: reels",
        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/rancho_GrPJz.html": "Try to collect both the yellow and green lights from the center top lane: get back to the top lanes via the kicker lane in the upper right. Once those are lit, use the right flipper to collect 50,000s from the saucer at the end of the left spinner lane, and use the left flipper to build bonus at the upper right kicker lane or complete drop targets toward double bonus and lit spinner.\nAll lanes initially score 1,000 points. The center lane will be lit either yellow or green, alternating on 10-point switch hits (which includes the rollover button just above said center lane). If the center lane is lit yellow, the right top lane will be lit for a bonus advance, and if the center lane is lit green, the left top lane will be lit for a bonus advance. If both yellow and green have already been collected, the center lane scores 10,000 points instead of 1,000.\nScores 1,000 points and a bonus advance once for free, and one additional team for each lit colour, for a maximum of 3,000 points and 3 bonus advance, before sending the ball back to the top lanes. This is the best way to build bonus, especially if you were successful in getting one of the two colours off the plunge, and is also the only real way back to the top of the table to get the other colour.\nThe spinner scores 100 points per spin, or 1,000/spin when lit, and is lit by completing the drop targets once. The saucer at the end of this lane scores 3,000 points, or 30,000 if the green is lit, before sending the ball back down to the flippers the way it came.\nScores 3,000 points when not lit, or 30,000 if the yellow has been collected. After two completions of the drop targets, this saucer is also lit for extra ball.\nEach target down scores 1,000 points. Knocking down all three the first time spells R-A-N, which lights the left spinner for 1,000 points per spin and also instantly awards double bonus. Knocking down all three targets a second time on the same ball finishes the spelling of Rancho and lights the left saucer for an extra ball as well as the out lanes (alternately) for a special.\nRancho has no in lanes, with the flippers backing up to the slingshots directly. The out lanes score 10,000 points and a bonus advance, or instead, a Special when lit by completing the drop targets twice.\nBonus is advanced by the lit outer top lanes, by the upper right kicker lane, by the standup target near the left bumper, by the rollover button in the center of the table when lit (alternates with 10 point switches), or by unlit out lanes. Notice that each bonus advance is worth 10,000 points instead of the usual 1,000. Bonus is doubled by hitting all three drop targets once. Base bonus and bonus multiplier are never carried from ball to ball, and there is no mid-ball bonus collect. Finally, notice that the first step of the bonus ladder is not given for free- it is possible to drain with 0 bonus, whereas most games would give the first 1,000 or 10,000 at the start of the player's turn.\nOn 3-ball play, the bumpers score 1,000 points, but on 5-ball play, they score 100 points."

Complete the Road or Kings targets to randomly light one of the three locks in the game. Lock two balls to start multiball, where all scoring is doubled. During multiball, relock the two balls within about 15 seconds of each other to score the Time Lock jackpot, then shoot under the now-raised right ramp for 300,000 points a shot. Lighting both top lanes and both in lanes advances the bonus multiplier and briefly lights the left orbit shot for bonus holdover.\nThe top lanes, labelled 1 and 2, and the in lanes, labelled 3 and 4, form a single set of lanes. All numbered lanes score 2,000 points and 2 bonus advances. Roll through an unlit lane to light it. Lit lanes can be rotated via flipper lane change with the right flipper only. Lighting all 4 lanes increases the bonus multiplier by 1 toward its maximum of 5x, and also lights the left orbit for Hold Bonus for about 10 seconds. The Hold Bonus is still lit for 10 seconds even after the bonus multiplier is maxed out.Going through a 1 or 2 top lane that is already lit will re-raise the center drop target if it has been lowered.\nHit a flashing target in Road or Kings to light it and score 5,000 points. Letters can also be spotted at the center drop target when lit, center ramp when lit, and right ramp when lowered. Spelling Road or Kings lights one of the three saucers for lock- upper left lane, center lane just right of the center ramp, and right ramp. Lock 2 balls to start multiball. Shooting a saucer that is not lit for lock scores 10,000 points and advances the Eject Bonus. The Eject Bonus starts at 10,000 points, increases by 20,000 points each time it is advanced, and is collected when multiball starts. The Eject Bonus is carried over across players within a game, but is reset at the start of a new game and anytime any player starts multiball.Once Road or Kings is spelled, the other must be spelled before the first can be spelled again. Spelling both Road and Kings three times lights the center drop target for extra ball.\nMultiball always contains 2 balls. All playfield scoring is doubled during multiball. Top priority when multiball begins is to relock the two balls within about 15 seconds of each other at any of the three lock locations around the playfield. Successfully doing so awards the Time Lock bonus. The Time Lock starts at 200,000 points, increases by the value of any scoring obtained in multiball, and carries over across players and games. I am not aware of a maximum value for the Time Lock jackpot, but I would expect a maximum of around 2,000,000 points, similar to the Hideout Jackpot on High Speed from around the same time. Once the Time Lock jackpot has been collected, the raised right ramp will be lit for extra ball for 17 seconds. Collecting the extra ball or timing it out will light the same shot for Mega Score, worth 300,000 points. Only one Time Lock jackpot available per multiball.\nIt may be desirable to use multiball to re-complete all but one target in the Road and Kings banks, so that it takes just one shot to each bank to relight locks and have another multiball ready as soon as the current one ends.\nThe Detour value starts at 50,000 points for each player on each ball. Shooting up the center ramp will put the ball in either the right in lane or the left out lane. (If the ball goes into the left out lane, the kickback will fire it back into play, even if the kickback is not lit.) This adds 50,000 points to the Detour value. Completing the Road targets lights the left Detour, and completing the Kings targets lights the right Detour; making a center ramp shot that falls to the lit side scores the current Detour value before increasing the value, and unlights that side. If there is a maximum Detour value, it is at least 550,000 points.\nRoad Kings has a conventional in/out lane setup. The left out lane scores 25,000 points and has a kickback that is on at the start of the game, turns off once used, and is relit by completing either the Road or Kings targets. The right out lane also scores 25,000 points. The in lanes score 2,000 points and 2 bonus advances, and form the 3 and 4 lanes in the 1-2-3-4 set.\nNotice that the one-way gate that serves as the exit to the shooter lane is very low on the table, positioned just above the entrance to the in/out lanes. The ball can access this area in live play and get funneled into the in or out lanes. Be mindful of this additional room for activities and be proactive about nudging the ball away from the in/out lane area.\nBonus starts at 1,000 points and is advanced by the center drop target and any top lane or in lane. Max base bonus is 99,000 points. Bonus multiplier is incremented by completing a set of 1-2-3-4 lanes and maxes out at 5x. Completing the 1-2-3-4 lanes also lights the left orbit shot for bonus holdover for 10 seconds. Max bonus is 5x 99,000 = 495,000 points. Bonus holdover keeps the base bonus to the next ball, but there is no way to carry over the bonus multiplier. Base bonus is lost if bonus holdover is not earned. If bonus holdover is earned on the final ball of the game, then the final end of ball bonus collect will occur twice, with the second bonus count occurring at 1x multiplier. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.\nIn competition/novelty play, specials score 100,000 points. I am not aware of a setting that assigns a point value to extra balls.\nThe Time Lock feature can be set to \"easy, regular, or hard\". I believe these correspond to approximately 10, 15, or 20 seconds, though no timer is shown in-game.\nHold Bonus can be lit for anywhere from 7 to 15 seconds. Default is 10.\nDetour Value can be increased by any multiple of 10,000 from 10,000 to 90,000 per center ramp shot. Default is 50,000.\nI have seen copies of Road Kings before where shots to saucers not lit for locks increased the Eject Bonus by only 10,000 instead of 20,000. I am not sure if this is a mislabelled setting in the game code, or a custom code set altogether.\nThe center target extra ball can be lit after 2, 3, or 4 completions of Road Kings. Default is 3.\nThe right ramp extra ball, which is lit after collecting the Time Lock jackpot, can be available for between 15 and 25 seconds. Default is 17.\nIf average ball time of the first two balls is less than 33 seconds, the center drop target may be lit for extra ball for free for the first 30 seconds of the final ball.\nThe Mega Score shot in multiball can be set to any multiple of 100,000 points from 100,000 to 500,000 inclusive.

Your bonus maxes at 7X and 39K base or 273K total. That\u2019s worth going for, of course, but you\u2019ll find the top qualifying scores arise not from 3 balls of maximum bonus but from one ball where someone maxed it and kept going for orbit after orbit and bank after bank. The target banks, once completed, either advance your loop [orbit] value or score your bonus value (unmultiplied) for additional completions. Think of it as a mini-collect bonus during the ball. You can get 2M on one ball just by keeping the ball in play and doing orbits and targets long enough. The four upper star standup targets each increase the spinner value by 200; get them all to make the spinner 1K per spin, plus whatever loop value you have. Completing all three drop target banks on the same ball lights double value on loop shots. Loop value starts at 1K, rises 1K per target bank to 10K, so that\u2019s 20K when the doubler is active. Loops are collected by going over the top star rollover button. Bonus multiplier is carried over from ball to ball unless you\u2019re at 7X; at 7X, it resets to 1X to start the next ball. One key is learning which targets not to hit from which flipper, e.g. watch out for hitting the center drops from the upper left flipper at certain speeds, which can drain down the center. Plunging involves a 3-way choice: full plunge to the upper left flipper, hold it up to have the ball deflect into the center target bank; full plunge, but flip when the ball gets to that flipper; or soft plunge to feed the upper right flipper and try to sweep the center target bank from that.\nPinVideosMatch Play*youtubeOPDBIPDBFlyer*\nSeawitch SS - Stern | 1980\nShortname: SEA\nPlayers: 4\nDisplay: alphanumeric",
        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/seawitch_GR6kB.html": "At the beginning of the game, follow the bonus X around the playfield, since bonus multiplier carries from ball to ball (unless you max it out, then it partially resets). The order is 2X center, 3X lower left, 4X upper right, 5X center, 6X lower left, 7X upper right. Drop targets build the base bonus. Completing drop target banks for the first time on a ball advances the loop value, and completing all 3 lights extra ball. Completing any bank for the second time on a ball scores a bonus collect (without the multiplier).\nThere are 3 banks: a 4-bank in the middle, a 3-bank in the lower left, and a 4-bank in the upper right. Each drop target always scores 1 bonus advance.If a bank has NOT been completed on the current ball, then the 1, 2, or 3 in front of it will be lit. This means that hitting each drop target will score and add to the current loop value. The loop value is 1,000 points for each lit insert in the large orbit, which maxes at 10,000 points.If a particular bank HAS been completed on the current ball already, the number in front will not be lit. This means each drop target only scores the current loop value, but does not add to it. When only one target is left standing in a bank that was previously completed on the current ball, it will be lit pink for Score Lit Bonus Value, which means that final drop target will be worth the current loop value PLUS the current base bonus count (without the multiplier).If the white X is lit in front of a bank, regardless of whether it has been completed on the current ball or not, that bank will advance the bonus multiplier the next time it is completed. The order in which the banks are lit for increase bonus X is set: 2X is at the center bank, 3X at the lower left bank, 4X at the upper right bank, 5X at the center, 6X at the left, 7X at the right. It's very important to chase the bonus multiplier early in a game, since it carries over from ball to ball.\nIf all three banks of targets are completed on the same ball, the in lanes will be lit for extra ball (50,000 points in tournament play) and the orbit will be lit for 2X Loop Value.\nA full plunge takes the ball around the big orbit loop. It can also be shot clockwise from the upper right flipper or counterclockwise from the lower left. Within the loop are 10 inserts that light individually, as well as one star rollover at the top. The rollover scores the loop value, which is equal to 1,000 points times the number of lit inserts within the loop (maximum 10,000). If no lights are lit, the star rollover scores 10 points only. One loop insert is lit for each individual drop target hit, but only in banks that have not been completed already on that ball. If all three banks of drop targets have been completed at least once on the current ball, the loop value collected at the star rollover is doubled to 20,000 points.\nNot always, but most of the time, if the ball is going counterclockwise around the loop, holding up the upper left flipper will send the ball into the center drop targets, which will deflect it toward the lower right flipper for a relatively easy catch. This is not 100% consistent since it depends on the speed of the ball as it comes around, and it may not work on your Seawitch at all, but it's worth looking out for and trying as a way to get a fast moving ball under control, or at least slowed down.\nThere are four standup targets with stars on them in the bumper area: three on the left, and one on the right near the upper right drop targets. Hitting an unlit standup scores 100 points and lights it. Hitting a lit standup scores 1,000 points and 1 bonus advance.\nThe spinner in the middle right of the playfield scores 200 points per spin, plus an additional 200 points/spin for each lit star standup target, for a maximum value of 1,000 points per spin. If bonus multiplier and base bonus are both maxed out, this is probably the best shot for more points on an already good ball.\nEach individual drop target scores 1 bonus advance. Lit star standup targets score 1 bonus advance. The out lanes and the secret star rollover under the upper right flipper score 3 bonus advances.Completing any drop target bank with a lit white X advances the bonus multiplier. Max bonus is 7x 39,000 = 273,000 points.Advancing the multiplier to either 6X or 7X (based on settings) will light the Specials around the playfield. Special can be lit on both out lanes and on the secret star rollover. Depending on game settings, the special will either move between all three of these locations, or it will always be on at the secret star and simply alternate between the out lanes in addition. Special is worth 100,000 points in competition play.Bonus multiplier is carried from ball to ball, but only up to 5X. If the bonus is advanced to 6X or 7X on a ball, it will be reset to 3X for the next ball.\nSeawitch has a conventional in lane/out lane setup on both sides near the flippers. Out lanes score 5,000 points and 3 bonus advances, and also can be lit for Special if the bonus multiplier is advanced to 6X or 7X. The in lanes score 500 points and are lit for extra ball (either together or alternately) if all three sets of drop targets are completed at least once on the same ball.\nTake note of the position of the upper right flipper and the fact that there's space (and even a rollover button) underneath it. If for some reason you are holding the right flipper up and the ball is in the vicinity of the top of the right slingshot, be sure not to release the right flipper at the wrong time and accidentally dunk the ball into the right out lane. This sounds like a niche situation, but depending on how you prefer to catch the ball to get it under control, it might be easier to do than you'd expect."

Boring? Yes to either, depending on whom you ask. This game is spinner-heavy, but with a twist. Like many games, it has targets you hit to increase the value of the spinner. The catch here is where and how those targets are positioned: there are three of them placed almost flat against the left wall of the spinner chute. There\u2019s a very narrow area where you can hit them; most shots at them simply go through the spinner without knocking any of them down because the sweet spot is only about a quarter of an inch wide. They\u2019re super difficult to hit from the left flipper which has no real angle on them; the right one is your best shot. A precise shot from the right flipper can make a sweeping hit that knocks down all three targets in the bank and continues on through the spinner; that\u2019s your best one, if you can do it. Another way you can get the spinner advance drop targets is to graze the post below and left of the targets just enough for the ball to bounce sideways into the wall to the right of the spinner. If you\u2019re lucky, the ball will then rattle sideways between the right wall and the drop targets on the left wall, which can also clear out the whole bank. In this case, the ball won\u2019t go through the spinner when it\u2019s done but fall back down, hopefully to the right flipper rather than draining down the middle. The spinner starts at 1000 per spin in value, but with each completion of the 3-bank, it goes up another thousand, maxing out at 7K per spin. Most Space Shuttle spinners are pretty juicy, so getting 50K-100K or even more on a good shot is common once your spinner value is high enough. Besides increasing the spinner value, finishing the drop targets opens your ball save gate on the lower right outlane. Whenever the ball goes through the gated outlane, it closes the gate, so you want to get the drop target bank again to reopen it. When you start the game, your first goal should be to complete that bank once to open the gate, even before you go for the spinner. There\u2019s a two-ball and a three-ball multiball on the game. Start by locking one or two balls in either side saucer. Next, knock down the drop target in the top center in front of the shuttle ramp. Finally, shoot the ball through the shuttle ramp, starting multiball. Ramp shots also raise the center post, protecting you from center drains, but not permanently, it\u2019s on a timer and will eventually retract. Ramp shots during multiball score a semi-random value indicated on the backglass. Multiball itself isn\u2019t that valuable, but it does give you a better chance to get spinner shots and knock down the targets, especially if you can get two balls in the chute by the targets at the same time; they\u2019re more likely to go sideways if they hit each other, and more likely to score those targets. The top U-S-A lanes, SHU and TLE standup targets and center T drop target all score points, add bonus or award values shown in the center of the playfield, but treat them as incidental, other than using your flippers to lane change to finish the ABC whenever the ball is up there after a spinner shot. You\u2019ll get some of them along the way, especially during multiball, but you should not try shooting at any of them. Shoot the 3-bank, shoot the spinner, lock balls and play multiball, don\u2019t worry about the other stuff. Lock stealing is active on this game! If you lock one or two balls, your opponents can steal them from you.

Lock one or two balls at the curved lanes in the lower part of the table, then knock down the drop target in front of the center ramp and shoot the center ramp itself. During multiball, or for a limited time during single ball after hitting the center drop target, the ramp is worth a constantly changing Stop 'n Score value of up to 99,990 points. The spinner just right of the center ramp is also valuable, worth 1,000 a spin and increasing when the drop targets on the side of the spinner lane are cleared, which also reopens the right out lane gate.\nLanes always score 2,000 points and a bonus advance. Roll through an unlit lane to light it. Lit lanes can be rotated via lane change with the right flipper only. Light all three lanes to spell U-S-A and increase the bonus multiplier. When the bonus multiplier reaches 5x, the in lanes light for Spot Shuttle Letter. When the bonus multiplier reaches the maximum of 7x, the dead-end right ramp lights for extra ball.\nLit bumpers score 1,000, unlit bumpers score 100. One bumper is lit at the start of each ball. Hitting any bumper rotates which one(s) are lit. Each completion of the spinner lane drop targets lights one more bumper.\nThe spinner starts off at a value of 1,000 points per spin. Along the left edge of the spinner lane is a 3-bank of drop targets. Each target down in this bank scores 1,000 points. Completing this bank increases the spinner value by 1,000/spin up to a maximum of 7,000/spin, reopens the right out lane gate if it was closed, and lights one bumper. If the spinner reaches its max value of 7,000 points per spin, the dead-end right ramp lights for extra ball.A spinner worth 3,000 or more is usually valuable enough to become the main strategy on this game if you are concerned strictly with points. The drop targets are basically impossible to hit from the left flipper intentionally, needing a bounce off a post or the right wall of the spinner lane. Try backhanding the drop targets for slightly more consistency. On some Space Shuttle copies with strong flippers and loose drop targets, it may be possible to sweep the entire bank with a backhand shot and still make it through the spinner and up to the top lanes; if possible, practice to see if this works, and try to execute it repeatedly if you can.\nS-H-U-T-T-L-E is spelled by the three left standup targets, the center ramp drop target, and the three right standup targets. Hitting any target scores 1,000 points. Hit an unlit target to light it and earn a bonus advance. Hit all 7 targets to spell Shuttle and earn the currently lit award in the center of the playfield. If the center drop target T is the last letter you need, it will flash instead of being lit or unlit, and hitting that target last scores an extra 100,000 points.\nThe Shuttle value is randomized at the start of each ball. It can be re-randomized at any time during gameplay by shooting the dead end right ramp. Possible awards are 20,000, 50,000, or 100,000 points; 50,000 + hold bonus; 100,000 + light out lanes; extra ball; or special. Extra ball and special can have their probability set to anywhere from 0-20% by the operator, so if you're fishing for extra balls, they may be impossible or require you to be very lucky.\nDuring single ball play, knock down the center ramp drop target to qualify Stop 'n Score for about 15 seconds. Or, Stop 'n Score is always running during multiball. Whenever Stop 'n Score is running, the three players' score displays not corresponding to the current player will rapidly increase from 20,000 to 99,990 then loop back to 20,000. Making the center ramp during this time scores the currently displayed value and raises the Head Shield center post between the flippers for 10 seconds. As a nice cosmetic touch, the 3x5 grid of dots that forms this game's bonus ladder will briefly light up the digits of however many thousands of points you score from a Stop 'n Score collect.\nIf there is only one ball in play and no balls are locked, the center ramp drop target willl re-raise when Stop 'n Score ends.\nDuring single ball play, locks are always lit. Lock a ball in either curved side lane to score 20,000 points and 3 bonus advance. Whenever at least one ball is locked, a full shot to the center ramp will release all locked balls for multiball. Other than the fact that the center ramp is always open for Stop 'n Score, there are no unique scoring opportunities or playfield multipliers during multiball. Use multiball as an opportunity to hit more Shuttle targets or more spinner lane drop targets. Locked balls persist from ball to ball and player to player, so lock stealing is in play. You do not need to be the one who locked a ball to start a multiball. Locked balls are automatically kicked out at the end of the game, however. Balls cannot be locked if there are multiple balls in play.\nSpace Shuttle has a conventional in/out lane setup. In lanes score 3,000 points, and are lit to spot a letter in Shuttle if the bonus multiplier is at least 5x. Out lanes score 15,000 points, as well as the current Shuttle award if they have been lit by the corresponding previous shuttle award.\nA gate in the right out lane will redirect the ball to the right in lane when open. The gate is open at the start of each ball, closes when used, and can be reopened by completing the 3-bank of spinner lane drop targets.\nThere is a large center post between the flippers that, when raised, completely blocks a center drain. The post raises for 10 seconds any time the center ramp is made.\nBonus is advanced by any top lane or lighting a Shuttle letter. Putting a ball in a lock saucer at any time awards 3 bonus advance. Max bonus is 69,000 points. Bonus multiplier is advanced by completing the U-S-A targets, one at a time up to a maximum of 7x. Full max bonus, then, is 7x 69,000 = 483,000 points. This is very difficult to achieve since bonus multiplier can never be carried from ball to ball. Base bonus can be carried, however, by the corresponding Shuttle award. There is no mid-ball bonus collect.\nSpecial can be set to points according to the game manual, but I have not determined the exact value of this. It is likely 50,000 or 100,000 points. Extra ball cannot be set to have a point value.\nThe spinner can be set to be unlit at first, having a value of 100 points/spin until the spinner lane drops are completed once to raise it to 1,000. The spinner value extra ball can be lit at the right ramp as soon as the spinner value reaches 7,000, or after one further drops completion past 7,000. The spinner value can also be held between balls instead of resetting.\nThe in lanes can be lit at 4x, 5x, 6x, or 7x bonus. Default is 5x. The right ramp extra ball can be lit at 7x bonus or require one further U-S-A completion past 7x."

The pin is based on the first two seasons of the popular Netflix sci-fi series.\nThese modes are accessible by holding both flipper buttons during attract mode until a menu appears. The following options are available:\nStandard:See below for full rulesheet.\nCompetition:Same asStandardbut with elements of randomness removed.\nChallenge:Play any wizard mode as a challenge mode. There is also a Demogorgon challenge mode with a high score for the most successful kills.\nDJ Mixer:NOT a gameplay mode. This mode operates like a Jukebox, allowing you to play the music featured in the machine, including a number of specific playlists.\nThe six objectives listed on the center of the playfield must be solidly lit to start the final showdown, meaning all missions must be played to access it.Make a 5-way combo - preferably early on, as this adds 10M to end-of-ball bonus.Make three shots to either ramp or orbit to start a chapter from Season 1 or Season 2. Shoot the flashing shots to win the chapter and collect drawings. Wizard modes are qualified after 4, 8, 10, and 12 chapters. Starting enough chapters lights an extra ball.Shoot the DEMODOG targets, then the left standup target, to start a Demodog Attack mode. There are three Demodog Attack modes in total.Spell words at the center drop targets, then shoot the scoop behind them to battle the Demogorgon. The five modes all play slightly differently.

Awards 5M + 1M per skill shot.\nSuper Skill Shot- Soft plunge towards the flippers, then shoot the kicker. Awards 10M + 2.5M per super skill shot.\nMXV Super Skill Shot- Make both skill shots on the same plunge! This requires a rebound off the flashing drop target that bounces into the kicker. Along with points from both normal skill shots, this awards 25M + 5M per MXV Super Skill Shot, along with adrawing.\nDirectly above the flippers, six inserts are listed from left to right:5-Way Combo,Send it Back,Demodog!,Demogorgon!,Light the Fire, andTelekinesis Multiball. Each insert solidly lights once their corresponding task has been completed. Once all inserts are solidly lit, the player will be able to attempt theFinal Showdown.\nEach objective will be listed in their own section, though Chapters will be grouped together as both sets are started similarly.\nThis objective solidly lights after collecting a 5-way combo. To collect it, you must shoot five shots, with each shot being within a few seconds of the last, and as long as they abide by the following:\nTheleft orbit, left ramp,burn it back/right inner loop, or right rampcan be shot five times in a row or any combination of those shots **Note: When ball lock is lit, it\u2019s much harder to combo using the left ramp b/c the combo countdown timer between shots appears to keep running while the ball is being held behind the up-post.\nTheleft orbit, left ramp,burn it back/right inner loop, or right rampcan be shot five times in a row or any combination of those shots **Note: When ball lock is lit, it\u2019s much harder to combo using the left ramp b/c the combo countdown timer between shots appears to keep running while the ball is being held behind the up-post.\nThesaucer, standup/mystery lane, middle (behind drops), and right orbitcan only be the last shot in the combo as they will end the combo\nThesaucer, standup/mystery lane, middle (behind drops), and right orbitcan only be the last shot in the combo as they will end the combo\nCan be collected in MB as long as it follows the two points above\nCan be collected in MB as long as it follows the two points above\nScoring a 5-Way Combo also adds 10 million points toend-of-ball bonusfor the rest of the game. Credit for the 5-Way Combo objective can also be collected from themystery award.\nTheSend it BackandLight the Fireobjectives are solidly lit once both sub-wizard modes have been completed. These are qualified after completing all six chapter missions from both seasons, for a total of 12 chapters total.\nStart a chapter by completing a set of three inserts underneath the left orbit, left ramp, right ramp, or right orbit. Shooting one of the aforementioned shots will light an insert underneath that shot\nStart a chapter by completing a set of three inserts underneath the left orbit, left ramp, right ramp, or right orbit. Shooting one of the aforementioned shots will light an insert underneath that shot\nUntil 2 chapter modes have been played, shooting the left standup lane will spot progress towards starting a chapter. It prioritizes spotting shots that are closest to starting a chapter.Note: If a Demodog mode is lit at the standup lane, it takes priority and will start instead vs spotting progress towards a chapter.\nUntil 2 chapter modes have been played, shooting the left standup lane will spot progress towards starting a chapter. It prioritizes spotting shots that are closest to starting a chapter.Note: If a Demodog mode is lit at the standup lane, it takes priority and will start instead vs spotting progress towards a chapter.\nThe left orbit and left ramp will start season 1 chapters, and the right ramp and right orbit will start season 2 chapters.\nThe left orbit and left ramp will start season 1 chapters, and the right ramp and right orbit will start season 2 chapters.\nInitial lit chapters are random but each hit to a pop bumper will change the selected chapter with the left pop cycling through season 1 chapters and the right pop cycling through season 2 chapters.\nInitial lit chapters are random but each hit to a pop bumper will change the selected chapter with the left pop cycling through season 1 chapters and the right pop cycling through season 2 chapters.\nCompleting a chapter will award 1 or 2drawingsdepending on how you complete it (see each chapter\u2019s section for details).\nCompleting a chapter will award 1 or 2drawingsdepending on how you complete it (see each chapter\u2019s section for details).\nWhere\u2019s Barb?(40 sec)\nAll shots are lit, with the saucer flashing. Complete the mode by shooting the shot that Barb is at (random). Shots start at 1M and increase +250k for every shot that Barb isn\u2019t occupying.\nFinding Barb on the very first shot awards 40M & an extra drawing!\nShoot the saucer (2M) to reveal where Barb is (one of the lit shots will now be flashing), then shoot the flashing shot to find Barb for 5M\nIf you save the Barb shot for last, it will be 10M instead of 5M.\n+2 Drawings:Find Barb on the first shot.\nMonster Hunting(45 sec)\nShoot the drop targets to collect items and set traps.\nFive waves of drop targets with scores starting at 1M per drop and increasing 500k each wave (1M/1.5M/2M/2.5M/3M).\nOnce one or more drops are knocked down, the drop bank resets and advances to the next wave(essentially, you get one shot per wave to knock as many drops down for increased scoring).\nAfter the fifth wave, all drops will lower and the final shot will be lit at the center.\nFinal shot value (7-28M) is determined based on how many drops you knocked down on the final (5th) wave. Each drop adds 7M to the final center shot with a max value of 28M if you shot all 4 drops down on the final wave(practically requiring a MB to accomplish since the drops reset as soon as one is hit).\n+2 Drawings:N/A\nBullies(45 sec)\nLeft orbit, left ramp, right ramp, right orbit are lit. Shoot all four shots scoring 1.5M, 2M, 2.5M, & 3M. The left standup lane will then be lit for the fifth and final shot of the mode for 7M.\n+2 Drawings:Shooting the four shots preceding the final shot in this order: right ramp, left ramp, right orbit, left orbit.\nGet Me Out!(40 sec)\nLeft standup lane, drops, center, and burn it back are lit.\nScoring is a little weird here as it varies depending on if you avoid the drops, shoot drops only, or shoot some combination of drops and lit shots.\nIf you don\u2019t shoot any drops, you need to shoot 5 lit shots to light the final shot at the center (scoring is 1M, 1M, 1.5M, 2M, 2.5M, and then 3M for the final center shot).\nDrops will also progress you through the mode and start out at 1M per drop & increase 500k after every 5 drops to a max of 2.5M per drop.\nIf shooting drops only(necessary to get the extra drawing & also the highest scoring potential), drops do not reset until you clear the whole bank of four. You\u2019ll need to clear 5 sets of the drop targets for the center to be the only shot lit for a final shot of 3M and complete the mode.\nWhen shooting a combination of drops and lit shots, each lit shot appears to progress like you have shot 4 drop targets but only scores (1M/1.5M/2M/2.5M) depending on how far along in the mode you are.\n+2 Drawings:Completing the chapter while only shooting the drop targets (5 sets). The center shot behind the drops can only be shot when it\u2019s the final shot.\nOperation Mirkwood(70 sec)\nShoot the left and right ramps to collect items.\nEach ramp shot scores 1M and both ramps will be flashing after. Making another ramp shot while it\u2019s flashing will act as a combo and add +1M to the value. Otherwise, the value resets back to 1M.\nCollect 10 items to finish the mode, with the 10th item scoring 10M or 20M if you\u2019ve shot every shot in a combo.\n+2 Drawings:Making a5-Way Comboduring the chapter using only the ramps.\nFollow The Compass(40 sec)\nOne shot will be lit solid orange. Shoot it to un-light and light another shot. Shoot four lit shots scoring 1.5M, 2M, 2.5M, 3M and then the fifth and final shot will be lit at the standup/mystery lane for 7M.\nShooting the spinner will move the lit shot\n+2 Drawings:Complete chapter without using the spinner to move a shot.Note: Starting this mode from the left standup/mystery lane tends to disqualify you from collecting 2 drawings b/c it hits the spinner on the way down.\nQuarter Hunt(45 sec)\nAll switches are worth 50k\nEvery 25 switch hits will score a level up (progress bar at bottom of display), worth additional points (1M, 2.5M, 5M, and 10M).\nBoth ramps are lit and shooting a ramp will increase the switch value by 25k. Once you shoot a ramp, it will not re-light to raise the switch value until you shoot the other ramp.\n+2 Drawingsby advancing through all four levels.\nSave Will(40 sec)\nCombo-based chapter. First shoot the right ramp, then left orbit, left ramp, burn it back loop, and then a choice between saucer / left ramp / left standup lane / center shot as the final shot.\nEach shot starts as a hurry up that starts at 2M + 250K per shot (2M/2.25M/2.5M/2.75M/3M).\nShooting all 5 shots in a combo awards an additional 50M and an extra drawing!\n+2 Drawingsby completing the entire mode as a combo\nWhat Mama Says(40 sec)\nLeft orbit, left ramp, left standup/mystery lane, Burn it Back loop, right ramp, and right orbit are lit with the left orbit flashing.\nThe flashing shot is worth 2x the current shot value and moves from left to right as they are shot.\nShots start at 1M and increase by 500k per shot (1M/1.5M/2M/2.5M/3M).\nMaking 5 shots will complete the chapter.\n+2 Drawingsby only shooting flashing shots.\nMorse Code(45 sec)\nBoth orbits are flashing and both ramps are lit solid\nComplete the message by shooting the right orbit/bumpers, shooting the spinner, or by shooting ramp shots (each ramp spots 3-4 letters).\nScoring hard to determine but you get about 16M upon completing the mode.\n+2 Drawingsby finishing the chapter with only shots to the right orbit.Note: Starting this mode from the left standup/mystery lane tends to disqualify you from collecting 2 drawings b/c it hits the spinner on the way down.\nLure Dart(40 sec)\nLeft orbit, Burn it Back loop, and right orbit are lit.\nScoring starts at 3M and increases +250k per shot (3M/3.25M/3.5M) with the fourth and final shot lit at the left standup/mystery lane for 3.75M after shooting the first three shots.\nDepending on Dart\u2019s current level (increased with thebumpers), the scoring from this mode will either start at 3M/4M/5M. (Each shot will still only increase by 250k)\n+2 Drawingsby shooting the lit shots preceding the left standup lane in the following order: Burn it Back, right orbit, left orbit.\nTurn Up the Heat(40 sec)\nLeft standup/mystery lane, Burn it Back loop, both ramps and the standups for each ramp are lit.\nThe two inner flashing shots score 2M and raise the temperature the most.\nRamps score 1M and raise temp less than the flashing shots (about half as much).\nEach ramp\u2019s standups score 500k and raise the temp the least (about half as much as the ramps).\nComplete the mode at the left standup/mystery lane once the temperature reaches a certain point (4 flashing shots/7 ramps/14 standups/some combination of the three)\n+2 Drawingsby completing the chapter with only shots to the left standup/mystery lane or Burn it Back loop (flashing shots).\nOnce each shot\u2019s three inserts have been collected, the next shot to the left ramp will begin aTotal Isolationmultiball mode. Total Isolation 1 is qualified after playing 4chapters, and Total Isolation 2 is qualified after playing 8 chapters. Normal add-a-ball rules apply to both multiball modes.\nTotal Isolation 1: Multiball similar to Total Annihilation fromAttack from Mars, where all the major shots are lit to score Jackpots (albeit they can\u2019t be shot over and over) and the center scoop will score a Super Jackpot worth the total of all the previously collected Jackpots after enough Jackpots have been collected. Jackpots start at 1M increasing by 100K per shot; if jackpots are shot as a combo, they are doubled. 3 Jackpots are required to qualify the first Super Jackpot, increasing by 1 Jackpot each time; and the third Super Jackpot will add a ball. Once all shots are required to collect the Super Jackpot, it reverts back to 6 shots for a Super Jackpot, and only 5-6 shots will be lit instead of all of them.\nTotal Isolation 2: Every major shot flashes for points. Hit a shot and it turns solid; then, shoot it again for a double jackpot. Making combos during this multiball also doubles the jackpot values. Do this for all lit shots to light the Super Jackpot at the center, for the combined value of all shots made.\nAfter all 6Season 1 chaptershave been played, the next shot to the left ramp will start Send it Back and solidly light its corresponding insert. Starting Send it Back awards a jackpot of 10M perdrawingcollected.\nAlternate shots between the major flashing shots and the center shots (DEMODOG targets, or the center scoop). Repeat this process once per major shot. The Demogorgon will be qualified after all major shots have been made; use the center ramp to bash the Demogorgon (or mouth shot for an instant kill) for a super jackpot worth the total points from the wizard mode. Normal play then resumes.\nAfter all 6Season 2 chaptershave been played, the next shot to the left ramp will start Light the Fire and solidly light its corresponding insert. Starting Light the Fire awards a jackpot of 10M perdrawingcollected.\nShoot the center shots (DEMODOG targets, or the center scoop) over and over. Each shot lights one of the DEMODOG targets.  Once all targets are lit, the center becomes unlit. Then you need to complete all the DEMODOG targets. The super jackpot, worth the total points from the wizard mode, can be collected at either the left standup lane or the kicker after completing the DEMODOG targets; the kicker scores double the super jackpot value. Normal play then resumes.\nSpelling DEMODOG with direct shots to the standup targets (or the saucer for the first Demodog Attack mode) will light the left standup lane to start Demodog Attack. All three Demodog modes must be played to solidly light theDemodog!objective\u2019s insert. Completing a Demodog Attack mode also awards adrawing.\nChapterscan\u2019t be started while Demodog Attack modes are running, but if they were started before the Demodog Attack mode, they will continue running.Demogorgon ModesandTelekinesis Multiballcan also be progressed towards and started during these modes.\nBreak Out!: (40 sec)\nAll DEMODOG targets are lit to kill a Demodog and score 1M\nHit15 targetsto complete the mode and award adrawing\nValue increases, when you complete all pulsing DEMODOG targets - 2M for the second wave, and 4M for the third wave.\nJunk Yard:  (40 sec)\nThree phases with 2 shots lit per phase (orbits, ramps, inner lane/loop)\nPhase 1:Both orbits lit. Shoot the same orbit twice for 1M each or shoot both with the 2nd scoring 2M plus increased scoring for the rest of the mode\nPhase 2:Both ramps lit. Shoot the same ramp twice for 2M/3M or shoot both with the 2nd scoring 4M/6M plus increased scoring for the rest of the mode\nPhase 3:Left standup lane & Burn it Back are lit. Shoot either shot twice for 4M-9M or shoot both with the 2nd shot scoring 8M-18M\n+1 Drawingawarded for completing phase 3\nIt\u2019s a Trap!: (40 sec)\nAll eight shots lit, score 3M each and unlight upon being shot\n+1 Drawingawarded for shooting all eight shots\nDemodog!objective insert will light solid upon starting\nComplete the drop targets to spell words and light Demogorgon Ready - each mode requires one more completion of the drop targets than the last. Once the drop targets are lowered and the purple arrow is strobing, shoot up the middle to start a Demogorgon Mode. Some are single ball and some are multiballs.(Note - if you can sneak the ball behind the drops before all of them are down and register the center shot, all remaining drops will be spotted and the current word will be awarded). All five Demogorgon Modes must be played in order to solidly light theDemogorgon!objective.\nDuring Demogorgon Modes, the action button flashes red, and pressing the button will use up theDemogorgon Bomb. Only one Demogorgon Bomb is given per game, and using it will kill the currently active Demogorgon for a reduced value. This also locks in the jackpot value during the two multiball Demogorgon Modes, and does not reduce the Super Jackpot value during those modes.\nBust Out!: Single-ball mode. A single shot up the middle into the Demogorgon will kill it for 15M, or 10M if you hit the sides at least once before shooting into its mouth. Alternatively, five hits to the side (100K each) will kill it for 5M. Minimal value. Don\u2019t waste your Demogorgon Bomb here.\nTrap \u2018Em!: 2-ball multiball. The Demogorgon is lit to score a hurry-up starting at 5 million and lowering to 500k. A successful shot into the center, or five shots to either side of the Demogorgon, will collect the hurry-up, lock it in, and light all the major shots for Jackpots worth that value. Collecting all the Jackpots will begin a Super Jackpot hurry-up at the Demogorgon, worth the total of all the jackpots combined; it can then be shot again for a second Super Jackpot worth the same value. The Jackpot value then increases, and the sequence resets.\nWhat\u2019s That?: Single-ball mode. You have to kill 3 Demogorgons. Each are worth 30M for shots into the mouth on the first try, 20M after any bashes, and 10M if bashed to death.\nRun Will!: 4-ball multiball. Phase one, shot the Demogorgon during the hurry-up to lock in the jackpot value. Phase two, all thedropsare lit for jackpots. Collect those to light the Demogorgon for a Super Jackpot hurry-up worth the total collected jackpot values; however, the ramp leading up to the Demogorgon will lower and raise every second or two. Collect the Super Jackpot to start the jackpot phase again and work towards another Super Jackpot hurry-up.\nCan\u2019t Stop This!: 5-ball multiball. Unlimited ball save for 60 seconds. Shoot red jackpots lit across the playfield - once all shots have been made once, the ramp will lower for a Super Jackpot at the Demogorgon mouth worth the total combined jackpot values, maxing out at 100M; then the jackpots will relight for another attempt at the Super Jackpot. Try to collect as many Super Jackpots before the timer runs out!\nLight locks by shooting the green standup targets on each side of the left ramp. For the first multiball, completing both targets once lights all three locks. For the second and third, completing both targets lights one lock. For the fourth and thereafter, two sets of targets light each lock. Shoot the left ramp to lock balls. 3rd lock starts the multiball. Chapters can be started before activating Telekinesis Multiball, but not during it.\n(On the Prem / LE, if another multiball is started while balls have already been locked for Telekinesis Multiball, pressing the action button willswipe a ball, adding a ball to the active multiball. However, swiping a ball will require another shot to the left ramp to lock a ball after multiball ends. There is no limit to how many times this feature can be used.)\nDuring Telekinesis Multiball, shoot 5 lit jackpots to light Super Jackpot at the left saucer for 6M; collect the Super Jackpot to solidly light theTelekinesis Multiballinsert and collect adrawing. The left ramp will also be lit to lock a ball for 20 seconds to double the Super Jackpot value (Pro); or up to two balls can be locked on the magnet for 2x / 3x Super Jackpot (Prem / LE). Regular jackpot values start at 1.1 million and go up by 100k per Super Jackpot. All values can be doubled again through2x Scoring.\nOnce all six objectives have been solidly lit, the next shot to the left ramp will start the Final Showdown. Starting Final Showdown awards a jackpot of 10M perdrawingcollected. (no spoilers here, though there is a surprise at the end of the game if you complete this mode.)\nAt random times (based on switch hits), the game might go into an alternative mode. Although progress towards startingChaptersandTelekinesis Multiballisn\u2019t visible during this mode, they can both be started during Upside Down 1 (but not during Upside Down 2). Upside Down can also start during a chapter.\nUpside Down 1: Each drop target scores a hurry-up value starting at 7.5M, which doesn\u2019t reset with each shot. Max value if all drops are hit quickly is 30 million.\nUpside Down 2: The ramps and orbits are lit for a hurry up of 10 million; each shot adds a multiplier to the value, to a max of 4x for the final shot. Carefully combo all these shots for big scoring, especially with2x Scoring. Max value is around 80 to 90 million.\nShots to the Burn it Back loop count up over the course of a game and award certain features after enough shots have been made:\nExtra Ballafter 1-10 Burn it Back loops and then once again at 50 loops\nSpell of Protectionat 3, 12, 25 and then every 14 loops after (39, 53, etc.)\n2x Scoringat 7, 18 and then every 14 loops after (32, 46, etc.)\nNote: Spell of Protection and 2x Scoring alternate as awards after 3, 4, 5, 6 and then every 7 loops.\nSpell of Protection is lit at the left outlane after a certain amount ofBurn it Backloops, or from amystery award. When lit, the ball will be saved from a drain down the left outlane.\nLighting Spell of Protection if it has already been lit will increase its value by 250K.\n2x Scoring is lit at the saucer after a certain amount ofBurn it Backloops. Shoot the saucer when lit to start 60 seconds of double scoring.\nEnough pop bumper hits will increase their value, evolve Dart and eventually award a drawing. The level Dart is at will affect the scoring on theSeason 2 chapter,Lure Dart. Pops start at 10k per hit and increase by 3k after every level. It takes 25 pops to reach the first level and then it takes same amount +5 more to reach the next. The first few levels and their awards are as follows:\n25 pops- evolve Dart (13k per pop)\n55 pops (+30)- 2nd evolution & increased Lure Dart scoring (16k per pop)\n90 pops (+35)- 3rd evolution & final increase in Lure Dart scoring (19k per pop)\n130 pops (+40)- +1drawing(22k per pop)\nNote: Future pop advances appear to only increase the value of the pops.\nCompleting certain objectives will collect drawings. Certain objectives will collect 2 drawings at once when achieved. Each drawing adds 10M to the jackpot collected at the start of all three wizard modes, and adds 2M toend-of-ball bonus. Collecting 11 drawings in a single game will light anextra ball.\nDrawings can be collected by:\nScoring anMXV Super Skill Shot(+1 Drawing)\nCompleting aChapter(+1 Drawing)\nCompleting aChapterunder a certain restriction unique to each chapter (+2 Drawings)\nCompleting aDemodog Attackmode (+1 Drawing)\nCollecting a Super Jackpot duringTelekinesis Multiball(+1 Drawing, +2 for a 2x Super Jackpot, +3 for a 3x Super Jackpot on Prem / LE)\n4th increase in pop bumpers - 130 bumper hits (+1 Drawing)\nRandommystery award(+1 Drawing)\nOdd-numbered completions of the return lanes, which can be cycled with the flippers, light the mystery award at the left standup lane. During timed modes, including2x Scoring, every other mystery award will add time to the mode; and if ball save isn\u2019t active, the first mystery award qualified during any multiball mode will add a ball.\nMystery is pseudo-random and will generally help the player out, but is deterministic in tournament mode.\nThe mystery animation shows a 20-sided dice roll, with each side corresponding to a different award:\nLight Lock (forTelekinesis Multiball)\nLightExtra Ball(15M if EBs are disabled)\n5-Way Combo(credit for objective + a cool animation)\nAdd-A-Ball\nAdvance Spinner Value +3k\nStartChapter\nLightBurn it Back(for the next award, eitherSpell of Protectionor2x Scoring)\nStranger Points (11M)\nHoldBonus\n+1x Bonus Multiplier\nEleven (never awarded)\nUpside Down\nMultiball\nAdd Time\nAdvance Dart (+3kbumpers)\nLightDemogorgon Ready\nBulls@!t (apparently it\u2019s just that, all switches score BS and some points)\nLightDemodog Attack\n+1 Drawing\nSpell of Protection\nExtra Ball can be lit at the left standup lane by:\nStarting 3Chapters\nStarting 6Chapters\nScoring between 2 to 10Burn it Backloops (percentage-based)\nScoring 50Burn it Backloops\nRolling 2 on theMystery Award(percentage-based)\nBonus automatically carries over between balls (outside ofchapterscoring), and is determined by totaling:\n10 million if a5-Way Combois achieved\nDemogorgon Modesstarted x 2M\nDemodog Attacksstarted x 5M\nTelekinesis Multiballsstarted x 3M\n10% of all points scored duringChaptersthis ball\nDrawingscollected x 2M\nMultiplied by Bonus X (increases by +1x with even-numbered return lane completions, maxes at 5x)\nBonus Hold can be awarded from theMystery Award, which will hold the bonus multipliers to the next ball. If Bonus Hold is awarded on the last ball, the bonus will be awarded twice with multipliers.\nStacking strategies:\nGeneral modern pinball strat of stacking Telekinesis Multiball onto a running mode applies.  Chapter modes must be started either prior to MB, or with the same shot to start MB.  An even better stack is to bring Demodog mode to the party, in which case youmustuse the following sequence: Start Chapter mode \u2192 Start Demodog \u2192 Start Telekinesis MB.\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend stacking Telekinesis onto a non-MB Demogorgan mode, unless you know you\u2019re able to consistently kill the Demogorgan with a mouth shot.  Otherwise, the big ramp flap gets in the way of your Mystery (Add-a-ball) and the Burn It Back shot.\nSome Chapter modes are better for stacking a MB onto than others.  Figure out which ones work best for you, depending on your play style.\nBonus can be HUGE. If you\u2019ve done a decent amount of achievements that impact EOB Bonus, consider spamming your favorite ramp shot(s) to get inlane completions toward maxing out your BonusX.\nDon\u2019t ignore/neglect your Burn It Backs!  Getting the Spell of Protection is like an Extra Ball, and well-time 2x Scoring can be massive with a good stack or well-played high-value mode.\nPremium: Use the Swipe-a-Ball\nAdded some scoring details to TKMB.\nShit. I think I overwrote what you added Chris. Take a look and see if you need to add more.\nDang it, someone beat me to making the rulesheet this time.\nI\u2019m liking what I\u2019m seeing so far! Getting an AFM vibe from this game for sure.\nSo far I\u2019m having a blast playing it. It has some cool homages to AFM (5 way combo, total isolation, and the extra ball animation). Shoots so good and the inner right orbit to left orbit return is one of the best shots in pinball.\nI also like how the left saucer fires the ball up the playfield. Wish it hit the inner right orbit more consistently though.\nMain gripe with the game so far is the demogorgon mouth is IMPOSSIBLE to hit. You really have to get lucky to make it. Good luck getting through all those modes.\nI\u2019m liking what I\u2019m seeing so far! Getting an AFM vibe from this game for sure.\nI wasn\u2019t wild about what I saw from the leaked pics and teaser/trailer. But after seeing how it shot on the DeadFlip stream, it looks like a lot of fun to shoot.I hope that the eventual polished call-outs also include a lot of the humor from Stranger Things.  We need more humor in pinball!  That\u2019s part of what makes AFM, MM, etc so great.\non your one the left inner loop goes to left flipper?  The one I played a clean shot goes to right flipper.  Also the saucer seemed to shoot the drops on the DF stream but it usually clipped the far right drop or hit that inner loop more often then not.  The code is also old on the one at the location I played - did they show what version was being played on DF?\nThanks to everyone for hanging out with us last night!Here are the VODs from last night.We also hit a pretty big milestone\u2026 our show has been see over 4 MILLION times!<3 <3 Thanks for the support, Pinheads\nTWITCH: (if you like to see the live chat)https://www.twitch.tv/videos/525565847\nYOUTUBE:\non your one the left inner loop goes to left flipper?\nThe shot to the left of the drops goes to straight back to a standup. Think the bell shot on ACDC pro.\nWhat does the action button do?\nIf anyone has a line to the stern team can you ask how the upside down is supposed to behave in comp mode?  It could be due to the early code, but still seems pretty random. I recall on stream it should be deterministic in some way.\nHow do you increase Bonus X?\nEvery other bottom lane completion (it alternates between Light Mystery and +1 Bonus X).\nSo is it possible to stack Telekinesis Multiball with Total Isolation? Because I noticed that the locks can still be collected if Total Isolation has been qualified.\nNot sure but you can definitely make progress towards modes and multiball while in the upside down.\nDid not realize that. I\u2019ve only played it twice, but just assumed that upside down shut everything else off. So you\u2019re just making progress in the dark then?\nYup, all the inserts are turned off. You just have to rely on the display to see your progress.\nThis really doesn\u2019t feel right.\nHas to be a code issue. Here is the excerpt from Stern about the Upside Down:\nThe Upside Down mode happens throughout the game at random times \u2013 just like in the show, you\u2019ll flip into the Upside Down. During this mode there are high point hurry up shots to make, then you\u2019ll flip back into the real world.No progress will be made for other modes during the Upside Down mode.\nWelp, there\u2019s our first bug to fix.\nI also knew that on early code the \u201cDouble Scoring Timed Out\u201d notification would stay on screen instead of reverting to the screen showing Demogorgon progress.\nPlayed a bit more today and focused on looping the left orbit for lane completions to build bonus x if I had made a bunch of game progress. Had a few bonuses in the 300-400M range. Definitely seems to be an overpowering strat at the moment.\nI was able to make mode/lock progress in the Upside Down some of the time, but not all of the time. It always seems to allow progress early in the game, but not always later. Maybe just before the first TKMB? Not sure, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be consistent.\nDefinitely had a couple left outlane Spell of Regenerations that failed to actually save the ball. Light turned off, then went end of ball on the drain.  Related, is it intended behavior to exhaust this when ball save is still running? I noticed one time it did when ball save was still active from a mystery award.\nAnyone noticing any sloppy inlane feeds from the ramp returns? The ball kind of rattles down the inlane guide and doesn\u2019t feed clean to the flipper about 1 in 3 times. I\u2019ve only played one machine, so it could be specific to that one but it\u2019s annoying and messes with my shot timing. Hopefully it\u2019s not a universal issue."

If by then you haven\u2019t got 5X bonus, shoot the saucer, then spinner all day.\nGo-to Flipper:\nLeft\nRisk Index:\nHigh; see Key Feeds\nSkillshot(s):\nCenter lane, to open the gate and light the spinner.\nFull Rules:\nThis game is largely UTAD through the spinner from the left flipper, except for shooting the multiplier saucer if the ball won\u2019t drop into it for you when caroming around in the bumpers. When the ball does go in the saucer, try to live catch the kick out from it to repeat the shot and get it to 5X in two or three quick flips. From the right flipper, tap pass to the left flipper if you can. If not, shoot the drop targets to score a few points and put the ball back up in the bumpers where it might go into the multiplier saucer or pop up one of the five top lanes. If the feed from the left \u201cjet stream\u201d chute is good, e.g. it lands on the right flipper and safely dead bounces to the left flipper where you\u2019d prefer to have it, shoot that instead. Base bonus goes up to 29K, so with 5X, your overall max bonus is 145K. In a good game, a high portion of your points will come from lit spinner shots and near-max bonuses. Completing the 1-5 lanes is mildly useful, making other stuff advance bonus and scoring 25K once you\u2019ve done it enough, but don\u2019t worry about it. Given a choice of having the ball go through a lit #2 to open the gate or through some other number to complete 1 through 5, take #2 for the gate. Ignore the four stand-up targets and five central rollover buttons. If the spinner is really juicy, ignore shooting at the bonus multiplier saucer and just go spinner all day. Key feeds: the saucer kickout; out of the chute on the left; and shots that don\u2019t go all the way to the top through the spinner but fall back.\nPinVideosMatch Play*youtubeOPDBIPDBFlyer*\nSupersonic SS - Bally | 1979\nPlayers: 4\nDisplay: alphanumeric",
        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/supersonic_GRLXd.html": "On the plunge, light the spinner and open the right gate at the #2 lane. If the spinner is lit, rip it for 1,000 a spin. If the spinner is not lit, rip it anyway to send the ball back to the top and try again to get the 2 lane. Out of the top lanes, use nudging and hope to get the ball into the bonus multiplier saucer.\nLit at the top: from left to right, they are actually in the order 1-4-2-5-3. A lit lane means that number is not collected yet.When the ball is at the top of the playfield, the 2 lane is orders of magnitude more important than the others, since it lights the spinner, opens the out lane gate, and is the only number that cannot be collected elsewhere on the table.\nEach completion of 1-2-3-4-5 awards 25,000 points and does something different on the table. The first time through, numbers light the center star rollovers for advance bonus; the second time, the left jet stream lane rollovers are lit for advance bonus; on the 3rd completion, the top lanes are lit for 3,000 each and the drop targets are lit for 3,000 per completion; the 4th completion and on lights all the rollovers (center and left) for 1,000 points instead of 100 and awards an extra ball (worth 25,000 points if EBs are off).\nThe 1 can be collected from the center standup target, and 3-4-5 can be collected at the right side standups. On some settings, the 1 and 3 are linked, so collecting one scores both; 4 and 5 can be linked in the same manner. Regardless, 2, can only be awarded form the center top lane.\nIt can be helpful to get the 3 and 5 numbers as well if attempting a spinner strategy (which is objectively the best strategy), since the 3 and 5 center rollovers are on the way to the spinner, so bonus can be advanced alongside the spinner being shot.\nAdvances the bonus multiplier to 2X, 3X, or 5X (there is no 4X in this game). Max bonus is 5x 29,000, or 145,000. This can be decent points, but any shot that could be aimed at the saucer really needs to go through the spinner instead, so stick to bounces out of the pops to collect multipliers.\nKnow it. Live it. Love it. Want it. Have it.\nUnlit spinner is worth 100 points a spin, lit spinner is worth 1,000. Spinner is lit by going through the #2 lane at the top of the playfield, and can be unlit by using up the right return gate. This is the only source of points in the game that is not extremely wood-choppy. If spinner is lit, shoot it very hard. If it's not lit, shoot it anyway, since through the spinner is the best way to get to the top of the playfield to try for the 2 lane again.It's entirely viable to shoot nothing but this spinner. Find a way to pass the ball from right to left if the ball is trapped on the right, then find and nail the spinner shot from the left. Even if the spinner doesn't spin super well or quickly, this is probably still the most efficient path to points in the game.\nWorth 500 points each (I think?). Completing the drops twice in ball scores extra ball (or 25,000 points). The third completion and on scores special (or 50,000 points). Completing 1-2-3-4-5 three whole times lights this bank for a paltry 3,000 point completion bonus. There can be decent points here, but shots to the drop targets put the ball farther out of control than shots to the spinner, so just stick to lit spinner.\nLargely irrelevant. Most of the time the rollovers give 100 points each and nothing else. As 1-2-3-4-5 are cleared for the second time, they will light for advance bonus, and the value will increase to 1,000 each after four (!) completions of 1-2-3-4-5. When playing for spinner shots, base bonus will probably be maxed before these are light for bonus advance anyway, and being lit for 1,000 is a downright insulting award for 4 completions of the numbers. Use the ball ending up over here as an opportunity to control the return, but don't intentionally shoot over here ever.\nLit by going through the 2 lane. The gate opens to the right, meaning that a ball in right out lane will be sent to the shooter lane, not the in lane. Using the gate unlights the gate and the spinner, so be sure that the resulting plunge tries to put the ball in the 2 lane again."

The primary goal of the game is to complete eight Episodes and fight the turtles\u2019 rogues gallery, with the Shredder and his army of Foot Soldiers being the ultimate goal. Along the way, the player will have the opportunity to level up their turtle\u2019s perks through Training Modes, customize the rules of Ninja Pizza Multiball through pizza toppings, and put their button mashing skills to the test during a Pizza Party.

The scores for Final Battle Challenge are kept on a separate leaderboard. The rules appear to be mostly identical to those in a standard game but possibly with a more generous ball save timer. See below for full episode details.\nHalf Shell Challenge:In this challenge mode, you attempt to get each of the turtles back to the LAIR one at a time by shooting 3 lit (whatever color the current turtle is) shots. Shooting 2 green shots will spot the leftmost lit shot. After collecting the 3 lit shots, all 4 Turtle Shots will light, shoot any one to finish that turtle and move onto the next one. Once you\u2019ve completed Michelangelo, the mode is over. There is a timer that tracks how long it takes to complete this challenge and a high score table to go along with it.\nDJ MixerNOT a gameplay mode.

You start at level 1 and therefore receive that perk at the start of the game.\nNote:Not sure where else to put this but I figure it\u2019s worth noting, Raphael\u2019s 3x PF and 3x Episodes are multiplicative and will boost your episode scoring (shots and completion bonus) by 9x (10.7x when you also consider the +30% Training Boost)!\n(Pro only) Plunging into the flashing top lane (always the one on the right) increases thebonus multiplierby +1x. Hold the left flipper if you want the ball to pass through the orbit and go right to the upper flipper.\nWhen you plunge the ball, a 15 second timer will activate to shoot the lit shot that corresponds to your selectedturtle. If you went for the above skill shot, the timer doesn\u2019t begin until after the ball exits the pops. Making the skill shot scores + 250k per skill shot and lights the Weapon insert on the right or left inlane forWeapon Hurry-Up. The skill shot only disappears when the timer runs out.\nShredder has devised a cross-dimensional device that could spell doom for the Turtles. The turtles\u2019 adventures take them everywhere from the streets of New York to the decrepit world of Dimension X, all the while taking on and defeating villains.\nThere are eightEpisodesthat can be started during the game, each corresponding to a different villain; most can be played in any order though some can only be played after an earlier episode has been played, whether won or lost.\nLighting and Starting an EpisodeLight Start Episode by shooting the left and right ramps, then shoot the pizza parlor to start the episode. Each episode has an insert on the playfield that flashes when it is the next one to start, and this insert can be changed via the Dimension X standup targets (left target goes up the icon list on the display\u2019s far-right column, and the right target goes down the list). Starting an episode re-enables theLAIRandAPRILtargets if they are locked out (cycling the letter inserts), and completing an episode adds a specific perk to theTeam-Up Multiballmini-wizard mode.\nStart 2 episodes: lights anextra ball\nPlay 4 episodes: LightsTeam-Up Multiballat the left ramp\nPlay 8 episodes: LightsFinal Battleat the left ramp\nGeneral Episode Information:Episodes are typically timed, starting with 30 seconds and adding time by shooting certain lit episode shots. In order to complete an episode, you need to shoot a certain set of shots to light theTurtle Shots,shooting one of these multi-color flashing shots will award theCompletion Bonusand complete the episode. Completed episode icons will have a green bar next to them on the display. Played episodes display in color. Unplayed episodes are grayed out.\nWhen you start an episode you are awardedEpisode Start Points. For episodes 1 through 6 this value starts at 275k and increases by 25k for every episode you\u2019ve played; for episodes 7 and 8 this value seems to be boosted by 100k (375k).\nEpisode Scoring:While each episode has its own unique rules, lit shots, and scoring quirks; there is aTypical Shot Value Progression (TSVP\u2122)that starts at 100k, and increases by 10k, then by 10.5k, 11k, 11.5k, etc. Some episodes include exceptions to the TSVP\u2122 as noted below. In addition, there is anEpisode Completion Shot Increaseof +25k for each episode completed, so 25k is added to a shot\u2019s base value before applying any multiplier. This appears to also apply to other episode shots that do not follow the TSVP\u2122, though there is at least one exception.\n(The Max base episode totals listed below include the Episode Start Points, the value of most episode shots and the Completion Bonus, but do not includePlayfield Multipliers,Training-related 10-30% scoring boosts, Episode Start Points for episodes that have been played, or the Episode Completion Shot Increase for any completed episodes. So these episodes can end up scoring significantly higher when stacking those things alongside them. They are primarily included to show the relative value of individual episodes.)\nLeft-side playfield insert on Shredder\u2019s chest\nTUMBPerk: 2x scoring during Pizza Party (Victory Laps)\nEpisode Start Points: 275k\nCompletion Bonus: 1M\nMax base episode total: 2.035M\nAll major shots (Left Orbit, Left Ramp, Krang Loop, Center Ramp, Right Ramp, Right Orbit) are lit and unlight when shot. Shoot 3 lit shots to light the Turtle Shots, though you can shoot all 6 lit shots if 2 of your first 3 shots are the Left Ramp and the Center Ramp, this will leave 3 non-Turtle Shots available while the Turtle Shots are also lit to complete the episode. The shot values follow theTSVP\u2122.\nLeft-side playfield insert, at Bebop and Rock Steady\u2019s elbows\nTUMBPerk: Either orbit will complete both Bebop and Rocksteady orbit shots\nEpisode Start Points: 275k\nCompletion Bonus: 1M\nMax base episode total: Appears to be no practical cap on scoring, just the episode\u2019s time limit and the number of shots you can shoot.\nBoth orbits are lit and stay lit when shot. Shoot 3 total shots to either orbit to light the Turtle Shots. The first 2 shots appear to add 10 seconds to the episode timer. However, both orbits remain lit alongside the Turtle Shots for additional points. The shot values follow theTSVP\u2122but yellow shots score 1x this value, orange shots score 2x this value, the 1st red shot scores 3x this value, and subsequent red shots will continue to increase this shot multiplier. Both orbits advance the base value, but each orbit has its own shot multiplier.\nRight-side playfield insert, touching Krang\u2019s brain\nTUMBPerk: Rescue Phase will light any un-rescued Turtle to be rescued (Note: There is currently a bug that makes your 1st Rescue Hurry-Up completion complete the entire Rescue Phase, hopefully it will be fixed in the next code update.)\nEpisode Start Points: 275k\nCompletion Bonus: 1M\nMax base episode total: 1.88M\nBoth ramps start lit, shooting a lit shot will unlight it and light the ramp or the orbit on the other side of the playfield, the ramp takes priority but if it\u2019s already lit, the orbit will be lit instead. Shoot 4 lit shots to light Turtle Shots. Shots follow theTSVP\u2122and it is possible to shoot 5 total lit shots, as long as the lit shot that you don\u2019t shoot as your 4th shot is NOT the left ramp. Basically, if the Left Ramp is lit for your 4th shot, shoot it and the other shot will remain lit for additional points.\nRight-side playfield insert, on the Mousers (below Krang)\nTUMBPerk: Flippers will change lit weapon inlane, lit lane will spot a Bad Guy shot\nEpisode Start Points: 275k\nCompletion Bonus: 1M\nMax base episode total: 2.425M\nThe LAIR Target, Left Ramp, Right Ramp and APRIL Target start lit; shooting a lit shot will then light those shots along with the center ramp and both orbits, excluding the shot you just hit. This continues for the remainder of the episode. There is no timer for the episode, but each of the shots can time out. If 10 shots time out, you fail the episode. Shoot 6 lit shots to light the Turtle Shots, there is no timer during the Turtle Shots phase but there are no additional shots to shoot. During the episode, any shots to the LAIR Target, Left Ramp, Right Ramp, and APRIL Target will follow theTSVP\u2122, the orbits always score 150k, and the Center Ramp always scores 250k. The orbits and Center Ramp are also subject to the Episode Completion Shot Increase.\nLeft-side playfield insert, at Shredder\u2019s fist\nTUMBPerk: Doubles Rescue Hurry-Up start value from 500k to 1M\nEpisode Start Points: 275k\nCompletion Bonus: 1M\nMax base episode total: 2.785M\nThe 3 ramps start lit, shoot a lit ramp to unlight all ramps and light the LAIR target. Shoot the LAIR Target (this can time out, unlight, and go back to lit ramps) to unlight LAIR Target and light the ramps again. Shoot the LAIR Target when lit 3 times to light Turtle Shots. The shots award theTSVP\u2122. If the LAIR Target times out, the shot values continue to progress. It\u2019s technically possible to shoot up to about 10 total shots, but 8 shots is probably a more realistic goal by having the LAIR Target time out twice.\nLeft-side playfield insert, at tip of Leo\u2019s sword\nTUMBPerk: Boosts Foot Soldier and Bebop and Rocksteady shot values by 250k\nEpisode Start Points: 275k\nCompletion Bonus: 1M\nMax base episode total: 2.08M\nThis episode consists of two phases:\nPhase 1:The Dimension X Targets, the Left Ramp and both Orbits start lit. Shoot both Dimension X Targets (100k each or 25k if spotted from the Left Ramp), then the Left Ramp to advance to Phase 2. You can also shoot the yellow shots at both orbits during this phase to add 10 seconds to the timer and score points (they are part of theTSVP\u2122along with the lit shots in Phase 2).\nPhase 2:All major shots (Left Orbit, Left Ramp, Krang Loop, Center Ramp, Right Ramp, Right Orbit) are lit and unlight when shot, shoot 3 lit shots to light the Turtle Shots. The first 2 red shots will add 10 seconds to the episode timer and are also part of theTSVP\u2122, so shooting the yellow shots in Phase 1 will increase the overall value of these as well.\nNeed to play Episode 4: Night of the Mousers to unlock\nRight-side playfield insert, next to Super Fly and Krang\u2019s android head\nTUMBPerk: Doubles Shredder Hurry-Up start value from 500k to 1m\nEpisode Start Points: Approx. 375k\nCompletion Bonus: A hurry-up that starts at 2.5M\nMax base episode total: TBD\nThe Right Ramp and Right Orbit start lit, shoot either lit shot to light Left Ramp and Left Orbit, then the Krang Loop and Center Ramp. Shooting your 3rd lit shot will light the Turtle Shots and start a hurry-up with an initial value of 2.5M, shoot a Turtle Shot to collect the hurry-up at it\u2019s current value and complete the episode. If you don\u2019t hit a lit shot for about 15 seconds, the APRIL Target will light, shooting it will add ~5 seconds to the episode timer and score about 100k points.\nNote: Still need to determine the shot values and what it is that determines their value\nNeed to play Episode 3: I Want A Body to unlock\nRight-side playfield insert, on Krang\u2019s android body\u2019s chest\nTUMBPerk: One Foot Soldier shot will defeat all 4 Foot Soldiers, but not Bebop and Rocksteady (both orbits)\nEpisode Start Points: 375k\nCompletion Bonus: 1.5M\nMax base episode total:  3.12M\nThe LAIR Target, LAIR Lane, Left Orbit, Left Ramp, Krang Loop, Center Ramp, Right Ramp, Right Orbit, APRIL Target will be lit yellow or red. Two adjacent red shots will cycle from left to right and then right to left, all other included shots will be lit yellow. The yellow \u201cKrang Missed\u201d shots score 25k, the 1st red shot is worth 296k, 2nd shot: 416k, and 3rd shot: 458k. Shoot 3 red shots to light Turtle Shots.\nNote: Need to determine if the \u201cKrang Missed\u201d 25k shots are boosted by the Episode Completion Shot Increase, if they are, shooting all yellow shots might be worth shooting later in a game otherwise they are probably worth avoiding.\nThese two multiball modes are available at the start of the game. After they have been played, one of thewizard modesmust be played to re-enable them.\nShoot the right ramp during normal play to advance towards Turtle Power Multiball. After three right ramp shots, the next right ramp shot will begin Turtle Power Multiball. (Donatello\u2019s level 1 perklights it instantly, too.)\nDuring Turtle Power Multiball, shoot the green shots for jackpots, starting at 100k +25k for each additional shot, maxing out at 250k. Collect 4 jackpots to light Mondo Jackpot at the upper loop shot \u2013 repeated upper loop shots score Double, then Triple Mondo Jackpot. Mondo Jackpot also lights the Lair for Jackpoto Grande/Super Jackpot. See values in theMondo Jackpots and Jackpoto Grande Valuessection. Green shots re-light and the Mondo Jackpot can be qualified with four more green shot jackpots after collecting Jackpoto Grande/Super Jackpot.\nShoot all 4 Turtle Shots to light \u201cTurtle Power\u201d flashing for an Add-A-Ball at the Right Ramp, and re-light all of the Turtle Shots \u2013 these also count as jackpots. There is no limit on the number of Add-A-Balls, but obviously there is a limit on the number of balls that can be in play.\nShoot the Ninja Pizza Parlor three times during single-ball play to lock balls and start Ninja Pizza Multiball. At the start of multiball, a list of perks is seen based on thetoppingsthe player collected while locking balls (read more below), and the three balls are released from the pizza parlor onto the spinning disc to start multiball.\nShoot lit shots to defeat Foot Soliders, each shot defeats a different number of Foot Soldiers:\nLeft Ramp: 3 Foot\nPizza Parlor: 1 Foot\nKrang Loop: 2 Foot\nCenter Ramp: 2 Foot\nRight Ramp: 1 Foot\nDefeat 6 Foot Soldiers to light Mondo Jackpot at the Krang Loop - repeated shots score Double, then Triple Mondo Jackpot. Collecting Mondo Jackpot also lights the Lair for Jackpoto Grande/Super Jackpot based on the value of all shots collected prior. Pizza Target \u201cJackpots\u201d can also be scored for small points and to collectpizza slicesduring this multiball.\nPizza Toppingscan be viewed at the top-right of the display, and are changed from left to right via shots to the 2 Pizza Targets during normal play; the first two are locked in with the first ball lock, the third and fourth with the second ball lock, and the fifth with the third. Multiples of certain toppings can be collected and affect the multiball accordingly. The toppings that can be collected are as eclectic as the turtles themselves, and are:\nIn both of the main multiballs, Mondo Jackpots and Jackpoto Grande/Super Jackpot are available. Mondo Jackpot is lit (white) at the Upper Loop by shooting enough shots (4 green shots for TPMB and defeating 6 Foot Soldiers for NPMB) and Jackpoto Grande/Super Jackpot is lit at the under-flipper shot by collecting a Mondo Jackpot. Collecting a Mondo Jackpot will also light a Double Mondo Jackpot (blue), collecting a Double Mondo Jackpot will light a Triple Mondo Jackpot (red). Both Double and Triple Mondo Jackpots are on a timer and will time out if not hit.\nMondo Jackpot Values:\nNinja Pizza Mondo Jackpot = 500K base (+250K)\nTurtle Power Mondo Jackpot = 350K base (+50K)\u2026but there\u2019s currently a bug where your first TPMB enjoys the 2x value for Mondo that\u2019s supposed to be reserved for your 2nd TPMB, so 700K base.\nSuper Jackpot Values:\nNPMB = 3M + 500K per Mondo since last Super\nTPMB = 500K (+125K), multiplied by the number of Supers collected (max of 3x)\u2026though the bug still applies to Supers as well, so first Super is currently 1M (500K x2)\nEach hit to an individual pop bumper will change which Pict-O-Pops award that pop bumper has lit, the awards\u2019 pictures are broken into 3 tiles, each corresponding to each pop bumper. When 2 of these tiles match, the award will be locked in and all 3 pop bumpers will continue to cycle through the remaining tile until it matches the 2 locked in tiles and give that award. Then it will repeat the process.\nPossible awards include:\nAdd-A-Ball (duringmultiball)\n\u201cBig Points\u201d (100k)\n\u201cReally Big Points\u201d (300k)\nStartApril Hurry-Up\nIncreaseApril Hurry-Up\nIncreaseWeapon Hurry-UpValue\nLight1-2-3 Foot\n\u201cAdd Time\u201d (+10 seconds, if a timer is active)\nLightBattle Again\nLightExtra Ball\nLightStart Episode\nLightTurtle Power\nLightWeapon\n+1x, +2x, or +3xBonus Multiplier\nBonus Held\nSpecial\nAfter successfully making askill shot, one of the inlanes will have its \u201cWeapon\u201d insert lit. Roll over the lit Weapon inlane, which toggles with the flippers, to start a hurry-up with a base value of 500k at one of the orbits. Shoot the lit orbit to collect the hurry-up and light the center ramp for another hurry-up worth the base value + the first shot collect value. The value of the hurry-up bottoms out at 50k before timing out entirely. The base value of the hurry-up can be increased by 125k from thePict-o-Pops, this applies to the base value of the first and second shots.\nInCo-op mode, the total number of Weapon Hurry-Up shots increases for each Weapon Hurry-Up qualified by previous teammates on the same number ball, they don\u2019t need to be started or completed. So if Player 1 qualifies WHU on Ball 1, Player 2 could potential qualify WHU, start it, complete it, and then complete it again. If the first 3 players qualified WHU on the same number ball, Player 4 could potentially qualify it themselves, start it, and then collect it 4 times for some decent points! The points for the Co-op Weapon Hurry-Up build the same as during standard play, each subsequent shot is worth the base value of 500k + the previous shot\u2019s collect value. So, in theory, it is possible to collect 500k > 1M > 1.5M > 2M > 2.5M > 3M > 3.5M > 4M for a total of 18M points.\nAt the start of each ball, the inner left inlane is lit to start 1-2-3 Foot. As soon as the ball rolls through this inlane during single-ball play, 1-2-3 Foot will start. Follow the lit 1-2-3 inserts to complete the combo; either right ramp - center ramp - left ramp, or right ramp - upper loop - center ramp will complete the sequence. The player has 15 seconds to make each shot, though 1-2-3 Foot shots that have already been made will also add time. So if time is running low, hitting the right ramp to keep it going is a good option.\nThe \u201cFoot Value\u201d starts at 50k, increasing by 1k for every spinner spin, the current value can be seen in the top left area of the display. The first shot of the combo is worth 1x the Foot Value, the second shot is worth 2x, and the 3rd shot is worth 3x, for a total of a 6x Foot Value for completing 1-2-3 Foot. Completing it will also prevent 1-2-3 Foot from being lit at the start of any remaining balls. Each shot also adds to the \u201cFoot Defeated\u201d counter inbonus.\nNote:1-2-3 Foot can also be re-lit as a Pict-O-Pops award. (Can it re-light this way if you\u2019ve completed it?)\nEvery odd-numbered LAIR target completion lights the Lair Lane forTraining, if Training is already lit, the 2x Target will be lit to start 2x playfield scoring instead. These difficult, timed modes are tough but quite rewarding as they increase all scoring by +10% for the rest of the game once won (up to +30% scoring), qualifyNeutrino Pizza Party, and are the only way to level up your selectedNinja Turtle. If the LAIR Target isn\u2019t lit (L-A-I-R inserts cycling), it must be re-enabled by starting anepisode.\nTraining Modes are timed, starting with 15 seconds and the LAIR Target will add 10 seconds to the timer to a max of 20 seconds (this max might be higher), other targets make a sound like they are subtracting time but only flash the red G.I. and stress you out. Each Training Mode has a set of shots that must be made in order:\nTraining Mode 1 (to Level 2): Right Ramp, Left Ramp\nTraining Mode 2 (to Level 3): Right Ramp, Right Orbit, Left Orbit, Left Ramp\nTraining Mode 3 (to Level 4): Right Ramp, Krang Loop, Center Ramp, Left Ramp\nNote:If your Left Ramp is lit to qualify \u201cStart Episode\u201d prior to starting the Training Mode, shooting the Left Ramp to complete your the mode will qualify it for \u201cStart Episode\u201d as well.\nAfter completing aTraining Mode, during normal play, completing the two Dimension X Targets before they time out will light the Left Ramp to startNeutrino Pizza Party. Progress towards completing the targets can still be made in other modes even if they aren\u2019t seen flashing. (Will it still award progress? Or is it just able to time out?)  You can only play Neutrino Pizza Party once per game.\nNeutrino Pizza Party is a single-ball mode, and starts with a set 30-second timer. During the mode, 1 shot is lit blue for 350K (left orbit, then left ramp, right ramp, right orbit, repeat) and the rest of the shots are lit red. Shooting the red shots will unlight that shot and build the value of all future blue shots by 200K (+100K) up to a cap of 5M. Shooting the blue shot will collect its value and reset the mode timer to nearly 30 seconds (seems like one less second for each reset). The blue shot value never resets. When time runs out or the player drains, the mode ends.\nEvery even-numbered LAIR Target completion lights the center target to start 30 seconds of 2x playfield scoring. Shoot the center target while 2x playfield is running to add 5 seconds to the timer. (2x playfield can be increased to 3x playfield fromRaphael\u2019s level 3 perk.) If the LAIR Target isn\u2019t enabled, it must be re-enabled by starting anepisode.\nPizza slices can be scored in several ways throughout the game - 5 are spotted at the start of the game if you\u2019re playing asMichelangelo, and shots to the Pizza Targets either during normal play or duringNinja Pizza Multiballwill add slices. After collecting 7 pizza slices, the lights will dim and the Pizza Targets will start strobing - shoot either target at this time to begin the Pizza Eating Contest. Time to mash that action button, as you have 6 seconds to collect up to 40 more pizza slices - 1 slice per action button press. The faster you collect them, the higher the value scored will be, usually around 2 to 3 million points!\nPizza slices also count up towards several other awards, points after certain thresholds and a litextra ballafter around 60 or so pizza slices.\nRepeatedly make shots to the upper loop to increase the Krang Kombo value, then shoot the center ramp to cash the value out. The Kombo value maxes out at 500k (with three upper loop shots before timing out), and collecting a Max Krang Kombo is required to qualify theCowabunga Wizard Mode.\nOn the Prem/LE, by using the player-controlled diverter, you can shoot the Left Ramp repeatedly to \u201cBuild Glider Value,\u201d after a certain number of shots (3? or what is max?) you will max out the Glider Value. Shooting the Right Ramp when \u201cCollect Glider Value\u201d is lit will collect it at its current value.\nNote: More Information needed: values, when lit, etc.\nEvery odd-numbered APRIL target completion lights one of the outlanes for \u201cBattle Again\u201d ball save. If \u201cBattle Again\u201d is already lit when a completion would normally award it, it will instead start anApril Hurry-Up. The lit outlane will alternate with slingshot hits (Game Adjustment#18can instead allow the lit outlane to alternate with the flipper buttons). If the APRIL Target isn\u2019t enabled, it must be re-enabled by starting anepisode.\nEvery even-numbered APRIL Target completion lights the Right Ramp forApril Hurry-Up. Shoot the APRIL Target when the hurry-up is running to increase the value by an additional 62% the first time and add time (shooting the APRIL Target will continue to add time by adding to the value but won\u2019t increase past the boosted 162% value), and shoot the Right Ramp to cash it out. If the APRIL Target isn\u2019t enabled, it must be re-enabled by starting anepisode.\nApril Hurry-Up starts at 100k; this value can be increased by 75k from the \u201cIncrease April Hurry-Up\u201dPict-O-Popsaward, and will be increased by the following amounts if the hurry-up is started during the following features:\nEpisodes- +250k\nTurtle Power Multiball- +500k\nNinja Pizza Multiball- +500k\nTeam-Up Multiball- +1M\nFinal Battle- +2.5M\nCowabunga- +5M\nExtra balls can be lit at the pizza parlor from:\nStarting twoEpisodes\nCollecting enoughpizza slices\nPercentage-basedPict-O-Popsaward\nBonus is determined through:\nBase bonus (switch hits, etc.)\nFoot defeated (either through1-2-3 Footor duringNinja Pizza Multiball) * 10k points\nPizza slices* 500 points\nEpisodes completedx * 125k points\nAll multiplied by the bonus multiplier, which increases by +1x through top lane completions and as aPict-O-Popsaward\nAfter playing any 4episodes, Team-Up Multiball will be lit at the Left Ramp. Depending on theturtlethe player selected, the player will have to make different Turtle Shots to rescue them from the Bad Guys\u2019 clutches. Each turtle also teams up with a different ally.\nEach completed episode provides the following perks for the multiball:\nBall save is active for 20 seconds (by default). 6 shots will be lit to defeat \u201cBad Guys:\u201d both orbits for Bebop and Rocksteady and the ramps and the Krang Loop for Foot Soldiers. Shooting a Bad Guy will defeat them and unlight that shot. Defeat all 6 Bad Guys to start a Rescue Hurry-Up at one of the Turtle Shots, starting at 500k points. Shoot a lit Turtle Shot to collect the hurry-up value and add-a-ball. Repeat this process to collect the 2nd Rescue Hurry-Up, then repeat it again to start a Shredder Hurry-Up at the Right Ramp, collect this hurry-up to light the final Rescue Hurry-Up. If a Rescue Hurry-Up times out, you need to (or get to, if you are looking to maximize points) defeat the 6 Bad Guys to start it again.\nShot Value:The Bebop and Rocksteady shots start at 500k and increase by 25k for each lit one defeated (not sure what the cap is). The Foot Soldier shots start at 125k and increase by 75k for each lit one defeated, up to a max of 1m per Foot Solider defeated. Rescue Hurry-ups and Shredder Hurry-ups all start at 500k and count down to 50k before timing out and relighting the Bad Guy shots.By timing out your Rescue Hurry-Ups and continuing to defeat Bad Guys, you can start scoring pretty good points, as long as you keep the multiball going. A full set of Bad Guys is worth 1.975m the first time, 2nd time: 3.275m, 3rd: 4.575m, 4th: 5.325m, 5th and on: around 5.5m+.\nShot Value:The Bebop and Rocksteady shots start at 500k and increase by 25k for each lit one defeated (not sure what the cap is). The Foot Soldier shots start at 125k and increase by 75k for each lit one defeated, up to a max of 1m per Foot Solider defeated. Rescue Hurry-ups and Shredder Hurry-ups all start at 500k and count down to 50k before timing out and relighting the Bad Guy shots.\nBy timing out your Rescue Hurry-Ups and continuing to defeat Bad Guys, you can start scoring pretty good points, as long as you keep the multiball going. A full set of Bad Guys is worth 1.975m the first time, 2nd time: 3.275m, 3rd: 4.575m, 4th: 5.325m, 5th and on: around 5.5m+.\nWeapons (spot Bad Guy shots)Shooting either orbit or the Center Ramp, whether lit for a Bad Guy or not, will light the weapon insert on that shot on a timer. Lit weapon shots will spot one of the Bad Guy shots, it can spot the Bebop and Rocksteady shots or Foot Soliders, and it appears that it may choose whichever shot is a lower value.\nWeapons (spot Bad Guy shots)Shooting either orbit or the Center Ramp, whether lit for a Bad Guy or not, will light the weapon insert on that shot on a timer. Lit weapon shots will spot one of the Bad Guy shots, it can spot the Bebop and Rocksteady shots or Foot Soliders, and it appears that it may choose whichever shot is a lower value.\nCompleting all 3 Rescue Hurry-Ups will startPizza Party(Victory Laps) and, if needed, award one of 6 requirements for the finalCowabungawizard mode (in the order listed in the section, from top to bottom, and not including Final Battle).\nShooting a lit yellow shot will collect the \u201cnext award,\u201d as indicated on the display, then be lit red/yellow to collect 2x the \u201cnext award.\u201d The 2x shot can time out if not hit. Pizza Party will continue until you drain down to 1 ball. The \u201cnext award\u201d starts at 150k, each lit shot will increase the shot value by 25k up to a max of 1m.\nHuge Scoring Opportunity with Leonardo and Raphael (to a lesser extent)\nIt is possible to play TUMB as Leonardo with \u201c4x scoring\u201d (5.2x scoring including the +30% Training Boost you get from being at Level 4) by having your Level 4 perk and 2x PF running. But even more interesting, if you start the Pizza Party (Victory Laps) phase and have the Pizza-O-Meter (2x Pizza Party) perk, you can have 8x scoring going (really 10.4X scoring when including the 30% Training Boost).This would allow you to shoot yellow shots worth 10.4x the typical \u201cnext award\u201d value and even better, the 2x red/yellow shots would be worth 20.8x the \u201cnext award\u201d value. The base value of the \u201cnext award\u201d caps at 1m so, in theory, you could eventually start alternating between 10.4m and 20.8m shots. It wouldonlytake 35 yellow or red/yellow shots to build the base \u201cnext award\u201d value up to that. But even after like 15 shots, you could be alternating between 4m and 8m shots.\nRaphael can do a similar thing in Pizza Party (Victory Laps) with \u201c6x scoring\u201d (7.2x scoring with 20% Training Boost or 7.8x scoring with 30% Training Boost). It\u2019s obviously not as large of a multiplier as Leonardo, but it involves 1 less Training Mode and Raphael is an overall better turtle to play as.\nNote:This is significantly easier to do with the saved Turtle Levels enabled by Insider Connected.\nFinal Battle is qualified at the pizza parlor after playing all 8episodes. At the start of the mode, points are awarded for each completed episode. 250k are awarded for any failed episode, and an increasing amount of points are scored for each completed episode as follows: 500k - 1.25M - 2M - 2.75M - 3.5M - 4.25M - 5M - 5.75M. So, if you complete all 8 episodes, you will be awarded 25M points total for starting Final Battle. These points can be multiplied by2x playfieldor by Raphael\u2019s boosted 3x playfield perk.\nThis episode works in phases:\nPhase 1:Multiball - play will continue if you drain down to a single ball. The 3 ramps and the side-loop are lit. Shoot 3 lit shots, then the Dimension X targets and then the left ramp to complete phase 1. Shooting a shot will un-light it, the other 3 shots will be lit.\nPhase 1:Multiball - play will continue if you drain down to a single ball. The 3 ramps and the side-loop are lit. Shoot 3 lit shots, then the Dimension X targets and then the left ramp to complete phase 1. Shooting a shot will un-light it, the other 3 shots will be lit.\nPhase 2:Single ball play. 8 shots will be lit, 4 red for Bebop and 4 blue for Rocksteady. Shoot all of the red shots to light the left orbit for a Bebop Hurry-Up, shoot all of the blue shots to light the right orbit for a Rocksteady Hurry-Up. Collect both of these hurry-ups and then shoot the left ramp to complete phase 2.\nPhase 2:Single ball play. 8 shots will be lit, 4 red for Bebop and 4 blue for Rocksteady. Shoot all of the red shots to light the left orbit for a Bebop Hurry-Up, shoot all of the blue shots to light the right orbit for a Rocksteady Hurry-Up. Collect both of these hurry-ups and then shoot the left ramp to complete phase 2.\nPhase 3:Multiball - play will continue if you drain down to a single ball. Shoot left ramp X times to defeat Slash, then shoot the side-loop X times to defeat Krang, then shoot the right ramp X times to defeat Shredder. Shoot the left ramp to win!\nPhase 3:Multiball - play will continue if you drain down to a single ball. Shoot left ramp X times to defeat Slash, then shoot the side-loop X times to defeat Krang, then shoot the right ramp X times to defeat Shredder. Shoot the left ramp to win!\nDuring any multiball phase, completing the LAIR Target will light the Lair Lane for an add-a-ball. The mode ends when the player drains all balls or makes the final Left Ramp shot.\nTo qualify Cowabunga Multiball:\nCollect aMax Krang Kombo\nCollect Jackpoto Grande (during eithermain multiball)\nCollect a Triple Mondo Jackpot (during eithermain multiball)\nCollect aWeapon Hurry-Up\nCollect 5April Hurry-Ups\nComplete1-2-3 Foot\nPlayFinal Battle\nNeed to add information about how this Wizard Mode works\n@CaptainBZarre, thanks for your faithful work on rulesheets and software updates!\nTop post of this thread has been Wikified for everyone to update as rule details roll in.\nCowabunga!\nThank you!\nDimension X targets are used in Episode 6 to chase Slash to Dimension X. They are also used in the Final Battle to go to Dimension X to retrieve the Neutrinos to help with the fight against shredders hoards.\nUpdated a bunch of stuff from the rulesheet posted by Stern\nAdded detail on behavior of altering and locking in Pizza Toppings for Ninja Pizza Multiball\nThanks for the work on this rules sheet. Very curious on how to relight Multiballs after the first go around. Doesn\u2019t seem to be possible at this point\nHopefully that gets fixed. I\u2019m suspecting Raphael needs some buffs as well, as-is he\u2019s only really good later in the game compared to everyone else.\nWhile we\u2019re discussing the individual Turtles, it also seems strange to me that Leonardo\u2019s 1st perk is essentially just getting to the 2nd perk quicker. In a way, he kind of just has 3 perks. This would make sense if there was like a Training Complete MB or some other feature that is good in and of itself. But as I understand it, there isn\u2019t.\nI mean, the 1st perk is given as soon as you pick the character, so you essentially don\u2019t have to complete the LAIR target to light the first Training. Also makes lighting 2x scoring easier.\ngreat point, I forgot about the Lair/2X pf thing. I still want a Training Complete MB though. haha\nHave these started shipping yet, or are we getting this information off of streams?\nThey\u2019ve started shipping.\nIf you drain while in a training mode and you haven\u2019t completed it, is it lit right away to retry on the next ball or do you have to spell lair again?\nAnyway to get back to the pizza eating?  I was Mike, got my 2x pizza eating right after playing the pizza eating mode.\nNinja Pizza Multiball locks seem to be relit after getting to pizza party. Just not sure how many shots that takes.\nCan someone explain glider?   Not sure I understand how it works\nFrom what I understand, when the lock bar button is purple it\u2019s available and when you press it it moves left or right so you can divert the ball where you please. Left flipper or right flipper.\nThe Multiball locks relight after completing team up\nIs it the finishing episode shot of the of the 4th episode that determines what Team-up Turtle is selected for the MB?\nI believe it\u2019s what ever turtle you pick at the start. Each turtles teams up with a different person."

        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/gameshow_G5V92.html": "When the ball is on a flipper, shoot for the top loop if it is lit for Spot Letter on the entrance opposite where the ball is. If not, shoot for the center ramp from the left flipper, or shoot for the Car drop target/Big Bucks hole in the top left from the right flipper. Light a prize by spelling it, then shoot the right ramp to collect it. Collect all 4 prizes to start multiball- the only different thing to do in multiball is shoot the right ramp immediately to collect the lone jackpot.\nOn any plunge, shoot the flashing lane for an instant bonus multiplier advance. Otherwise, light all 3 lanes to advance the bonus multiplier. Lit lanes can be moved via lane change, but the flashing skill shot lane cannot. Both flippers can be used for the lane change, but they both rotate the lanes in the same direction.\nSpell a prize by hitting all of its targets to light it. The TV is spelled at the red targets just left of the center ramp; the Trip is at the 4 blue targets on the far right; the Truck is at the 5 green targets on the far left; and the Car is the single drop target in the back left of the game. Completing a prize lights it at the right ramp, and lights the right ramp for Collect.To squeeze the most points out of how this works, collect the Car first, then be sure to make the right ramp after each prize is lit, so that the Car value is collected all 4 times. The Car scores 200,000 points, the Truck scores 100,000, the Trip scores 50,000, and the TV scores 25,000. Making the right ramp after collecting all 4 prizes locks a ball, and the next ball plunged starts multiball.\nDuring multiball, the first and only order of business is to shoot the right ramp as quickly as possible. The right ramp holds the Showcase Bonanza Grand Prize: this jackpot is worth 3,000,000 for 5 seconds at the start of multiball, then loses 100,000 per second, until bottoming out at 1,000,000 and staying there until collected. There is a 5-second grace period on the Grand Prize if it is not collected before one of the two balls drains. There are no other multiball-specific features; everything is in play, with the ability to collect the prizes again with 2 balls in play.\nThe Big Bucks hole is directly behind the Car drop target. Making Big Bucks the first time on a ball scores 100,100 points. Each subsequent Big Bucks collect scores 100,100 more than the last, up to a maximum of 900,900. After every 2 Big Bucks collects, the Car drop target will re-raise, making it just a little harder to combo this shot repeatedly. The hole itself brings the ball back to the right flipper. The Big Bucks value resets at the end of each ball.\nThe upper loop goes around the pop bumpers. The left entrance is in the far upper left of the game, and the right entrance is between the center and right ramps. One of the two entrances will always be lit for Spot Letter; which entrance is lit alternates with each pop bumper hit. Making the loop through the lit entrance awards a letter in the lowest value prize that has not yet been collected: TV, then Trip, then Truck, then Car. (The Car can be given with a single spot, since it just requires one target.)A weak loop shot puts the ball in the $ top lanes; a strong right loop shot brings the ball down the left orbit, and a strong left loop shot puts the ball in the pop bumpers. The spinner near the right entrance scores 1,000 points per spin, or it can be briefly lit for 3,000/spin by going through the left in lane. The left loop entrance is lit for an extra ball by the corresponding Wheel award. Both entrances to the loop are very briefly lit for 2,000,000 points after collecting the \"Light 4 Million\" Wheel award as well.\nAt the beginning of each ball, and whenever the Wheel is lit for Spin, the wheel in the center of the playfield spins and lands on a random number between 5,000 and 50,000. After a successful spin, the ramp is lit for Nudge, which advances the wheel one position for the purpose of collecting awards. Landing on a wedge scores that wedge's value; also, hitting any letter target in the game toward a prize scores 10,000 points plus the lit wheel value.\nThe Wheel values that are not multiples of 10,000 also have secondary awards:\n5,000 also has Lite Extra Ball\n15,000 also has Instant 250,000\n25,000 also has Hold Bonus\n35,000 also has Instant 1 Million\n45,000 also has Lite 4 Million\nInstant 250,000, Instant 1,000,000, and Hold Bonus are always available from the beginning of each ball. Lite Extra Ball cannot be collected until after at least 1 prize has been lit on the current ball.Lite 4 Million cannot be lit until the player has made 3 Spot Letter shots within any 18-second span on the current ball. When Lite 4 Million is collected, both entrances to the upper loop light for about 5 seconds for 2,000,000 points each- you need to be really quick and really accurate to get the full 4,000,000 out of this mini-mode. Once one of the secondary awards has been collected, it cannot be earned again until the current ball in play ends or until all 5 secondary awards have been collected.\nThe right in lane lights a 5X Spin. The next ramp shot within about 10 seconds will score 5X whatever value the wheel lands on (but the target value is not multiplied).\nBally Game Show has a conventional in/out lane setup. The left in lane lights the spinner for 3,000 a spin for a few seconds. The right in lane lights the center ramp for a 5x Wheel Spin for a few seconds. The out lanes are lit alternately for an extra ball by advancing the bonus to 4x.\nMost lanes and targets advance the bonus (I have not figured out the exact distribution of this, but the top lanes and most letter targets seem to give 2 advances). Bonus multipliers are award by lighting all 3 top lanes, or by going through the center lane when it's flashing on a skill shot. Even though the table inserts look like they can count up to 15x 255,000 bonus, the actual maximum is 10x 250,000 = 2,500,000 points. Bonus tends not to hold too much value until at least 5x multiplier has been earned. Bonus and bonus multiplier are both held for the next ball only by collecting the Hold Bonus secondary wheel award, but there is no other way to hold bonus between balls and there is no mid-ball bonus collect.\nAccording to the manual, a special would be worth a pitiful 100,000 points, but there are no Special awards in this game. Presumably, an extra ball would give 100,000 points as well in competition/novelty play.\nIn lanes can be set to spot Prize Letters.\nLane change on the top lanes can be disabled.\nThe out lane extra ball can be set to light when 3x, 4x, or 8x (!) bonus is achieved.\nThe timers for the Nudge option on the wheel, the 5X Spin, the Grand Prize, and the 4 Million can be set to \"yes\" or \"no\", with \"yes\" being longer, but the exact length of each timer is not specified."

The machine is based on the \u201cDays of Future Past\u201d story arc from the comics. Players will complete missions and objectives to enable Cerebro for time travel, allowing them to save the future by changing the past.\n|\n| \u2014 | \u2014 |\nThese modes are accessible by holding both flipper buttons during attract mode until a menu appears. The following options are available:\nStandard:\nSee below for full rulesheet.\nCompetition:\nCompetition:\nDJ Mixer\nDJ Mixer\nNOT a gameplay mode. This mode operates like a jukebox, allowing you to play the music featured in the machine, including a number of specific playlists.\nCompetition Install\nNot from the gameplay menu, but the following is changed if a Competition Install is performed from the utilities menu:\nThe default skill shot is to soft plunge into the lane near the highway ramp entrance for 200k. 2x skill shot is awarded if the ball only hits one of the two switches in the lane instead of both.\nThere are also three skill shots available by full plunging while holding the left flipper:\nHit the X-Jet shot to feed the X-Mansion ramp. If the ball enters the ramp, the danger room exit ramp can then be hit for a super skill shot.\nHit the downtown shot repeatedly for up to a 5-way time loop combo. If all 5 shots were made, the left ramp can be hit for the final shot in the sequence.\nHit the left ramp for a Cerebro skill shot.\nHit up to four white shots to start the next mission (the first one starts after just one, but more are needed for every mission completed). Missions can be started at any ramp that feeds the inlanes or Cerebro.\nCompleting missions is one way to recruit X-Men to makethe futureeasier to complete or enhance scoring during the mode, and the respective X-Men members are listed next to each mission name.\nAll eight missions are available at the start of the game. The corner Tier 1 missions are less challenging but slightly less valuable than the Tier 2 missions in between them.\nExtra ballis lit at the right inlane after 3 missions, then 7 missions, have been completed.\nModes are listed clockwise.\nTier 1s:\nRescue the Innocent(Bishop): 6 red shots to rescue each innocent citizen - they alternate from left to right sides of the playfield. Bishop pop bumper increases the multiplier for each shot up to 5x. Perfect - score at least one shot worth 5x.\nBitter Rivalry(Wolverine): 4 random shots are lit, 3 yellow and 1 blue. Hit four shots to defeat Sabretooth. Blue shots score more. The lit shots are reshuffled after each shot made. Perfect - hit nothing but blue shots.\nSmuggled Cargo(Gambit): 5 red, then 3 blue shots to recover the cargo. Blinking purple arrows score double damage & progress (they move from left to right). Perfect - hit nothing but purple shots (5 shots to finish total).\nStopping a Juggernaut(Professor X): Hit a maximum of 6 red shots to defeat Juggernaut. Making a shot unlights it for a few seconds or until another shot is made. Combos score more and deal 2x damage & progress. Perfect - complete the mode in a single, 4-way combo.\nTier 2s:\nSentinel Facility Raid(Rogue): Shots move from right to left. Make a shot to defeat the moving Sentinels on the assembly line. Sentinel target hits stop them from moving for a few seconds. Perfect - hit nothing but the farthest lit shots (to the right) in the wave (?)\nA Fiery Assault(Storm): All shots are initially lit red. Shoot a red shot to extinguish Pyro\u2019s flames and turn the shot blue. Shoot a blue shot to damage him and unlight the shot. 3 blue shots to finish. Perfect - collect all red shots before collecting any blue shots, then collect 3 blue shots.\nMayhem in Midtown(Colossus): Hit the targets in between shots to light the two shots flanking the target yellow. Hitting the targets enough times lights red shots for 2x progression. 5 yellow shots to complete. Perfect - hit at least one red shot.\nGenosha Under Siege(Magneto): Red shots defeat Magneto, and green shots defeat Toad for bonus scores (but move around from left to right) & open up Magneto for a short time. Green shots are worth 2x red shots. Perfect - hit Magneto by first hitting a green shot, then the quickly flashing red shot that was behind it.\nThe Future is a work-in-progress and is not complete as of 0.89 code. It will evolve as code is completed.\nThe Future is a \u201cmarathon\u201d mode qualified at every twomissionscompleted. When lit, it will start at Cerebro.\nIn the future, Sentinels have taken over and other modes cannot be started. All shots are lit to score awards but can be blocked by Sentinels\u2019 lit inserts if the player takes too long. The number of lit inserts occupied by Sentinels starts at 4 and decreases by 1 every time the future is reached during a game.\nIf the player defeats enough Sentinels, however,Nimrodwill spawn. Originally created as a prototype Sentinel, Nimrod is invulnerable to physical harm and the player\u2019s only choice will be to escape by hitting three randomly lit flashing lanes. If Nimrod catches up to the player within 30 seconds, a large quantity of Sentinels will spawn; if the player escapes, all Sentinels will retreat, opening up all shots to make progress again.\nCompleting certain tasks allows the player to score more out of The Future, or make it easier to defeat Sentinels and complete. Click the tab below to view each perk.\nPressing the action button allows the player to head back to the past by shooting any Cerebro ramp when flashing, or they can keep going by pressing the action button to deactivate Cerebro. 3 lit shots are needed to light Cerebro the first time, then 8, then 15. After the third future, draining is the only way to exit the future and return to normal play unless the mode is completed.\nReach the facility by making 50 lit white shots for an 100M bonus & reset themissionsgrid.\nMultiballs can all be played with each other if played in the following order:Save the City,Sentinel,To Me, My X-Men. Save the City and To Me, My X-Men can be stacked on their own, but the latter prevents Sentinel from being started.\nEarn add-a-balls by scoring them fromBeast\u2019s lab, but only at level 2.\nHit the giant sentinel 3 times (+2 per multi) to spawn it. While the giant sentinel is active, decrease its integrity with more direct hits to it. Eventually, it\u2019s mouth will open up; defeat the giant sentinel by hitting it enough times to start the multiball. Making aFastball Specialcombo will advance the Sentinel to its next stage immediately.\nDuring the multiball, shoot the random flashing sentinel shots for jackpots (two for the first wave, three for the next, etc). Defeating a sentinel by clearing all shots of the same color will cause the giant sentinel to spawn again and light a variety of purple shots to increase the super jackpot. Decrease its integrity with direct hits, like you did before, to score a super jackpot and repeat the process. The super jackpot value is held across the entire game.\nThe playfield\u2019s shots all have a unique \u201clevel\u201d that are advanced by hitting them multiple times. They reach the first level with two shots, and as soon as all shots reach the same level, the midtown shot will be lit to start Save the City.\nThere are five areas of the city that can be lit for jackpot via enough hits to their corresponding shots, listed in the UI:\nDowntown loop - ramps\nUptown (left) ramp - orbits\nMidtown (center) ramp - targets\nSubway (right) loop - spinners\nHighway (right) ramp - bumpers\nEach hit to the corresponding targets listed above increases the jackpot value scored at their respective shot, if their jackpot is already lit. The sixth jackpot of the set isalwaysat the X-Jet ramp and lights after all five other jackpots have been scored; it is a super jackpot worth 2x the current jackpot value.\nJackpots can only be earned at each shot once until a super jackpot is scored.\nHit the gray targets 5 times to light Cerebro to advance towards this multiball. To Me, My X-Men starts when Cerebro has been lit and collected three times for the first multiball.\nHit six blue lit shots to \u201csummon\u201d X-Men and score jackpots. The same shot cannot be hit more than one time in a row. Every sixth jackpot lights a super jackpot at the left ramp worth the jackpot total, and a 2x super jackpot that can be earned at the danger room exit ramp.\nThe danger room is accessed by hitting the X-Jet shot to feed it, or the ball can fall into it on its own. Exiting the danger room via the ramp also counts as a Cerebro shot (when lit) and can start a mission when available.\nLeveling up the danger room increases the scoring for allmissionsandmultiballs. The danger room can be leveled up (up to level 3).  There are 4 elements required to upgrade the danger room (the number of times required is indicated at the top of the display):\nRipping the spinner (Required Spins: 30/60/65)\nHitting standup targets: Abort, target near the level indicator insert, thin diagonal target next to ramp (Required Targets: 3/3/6)\nExiting via the ramp (Required Exits: 2/3/3)\nHitting the bumper - must be hit fromwithinthe danger room (Required Pops: 2/4/5)\nThe danger room will automatically level-up once all conditions are met.\n\u201cAbort\u201d saves can also be earned by hitting the X-Jet shot to access the danger room enough times - the first save lights after three shots. Hitting the \u201cabort\u201d target activates a ball save that saves any balls draining from the danger room or the main playfield for 5 seconds.\nThe danger room is normally disabled duringthe future, but can be advanced during the future if theStopping a Juggernautmission was completed.\nHitting the left pop bumper enough times will build up Bishop\u2019s power. Degrees of charge determine how many lanes it will cover (1/2/3). When the action button is flashing red, holding it will start moving a light blue arrow left to right across the playfield and back. Release the action button to spot the shot(s) that it landed on.\nBishop will never spot the Sentinel shot or any danger room shot.\nBishop cannot be activated duringthe futureunless theRescue the Innocentmission has been completed, in which case the action button rule will behave as it does in normal play.\nThere is a hidden lane below the entrance to the downtown ramp. Shots to this lane that fall in accidentally score a value that starts at 500k and increase by 250k with each shot to the target gating it.\nDuringmissions, this lane spots the leftmost lit shot on the playfield when hit, for half of the normal shot value.\nKitty Pryde\u2019s lane is normally disabled duringthe future. Qualify Colossus by completing theMayhem in Midtownmission to enable this rule. If qualified this way, the lane will collect the next future mode shot any time it is hit during the mode instead of the Kitty Pryde value.\nHit the captive ball in Beast\u2019s Lab with enough strength to collect a context-sensitive award based on its current level (increased by hitting shots surrounding it). It can:\nLevel 1:Add time (during atimed mission)Spot a progress shot (duringthe future)Score one portion ofend-of-ball bonus(not subject to bonus X)\nAdd time (during atimed mission)\nSpot a progress shot (duringthe future)\nScore one portion ofend-of-ball bonus(not subject to bonus X)\nLevel 2:Add-a-ball (if anymultiballis running)Double nextmissionprogress shot (if one isn\u2019t running)LightX-Mansion ball saveScore 5.5M\nAdd-a-ball (if anymultiballis running)\nDouble nextmissionprogress shot (if one isn\u2019t running)\nLightX-Mansion ball save\nScore 5.5M\nLevel 3:Light extra ball(always the first level 3 award)Qualify Beast for use inthe future(always the second level 3 award)Increase the next shot\u2019smultiplierto 3xScore 10M\nLight extra ball(always the first level 3 award)\nQualify Beast for use inthe future(always the second level 3 award)\nIncrease the next shot\u2019smultiplierto 3x\nScore 10M\nBeast\u2019s Lab is disabled inthe futureunless Beast has been qualified via scoring a level 3 Beast\u2019s Lab award. Certain other X-Men perks will \u201cnormalize\u201d Beast\u2019s Lab awards during the future, either lighting X-Mansion ball save or spotting a mode progress shot for the next lab award collected.\nHit Gambit\u2019s bumper three times to increase the value of the next mode or multiball shot to 2x.\nShatzing / alley passing the bumper immediately increases the next mode shot\u2019s value to 2x.\nThe shot multiplier rule is disabled inthe futureunless Gambit has been qualified by completing theSmuggled Cargomission.\nThis 2-shot combo sequence is lit at the right inlane after completing enough sets of standup targets.\nWhen active, a ball return to the right inlane lights a strobing shot up the left ramp. Collect for 500k, ball returns to left flipper then combo shot the Sentinel to score 2.5M. Completing the Fastball Special combo will also advance to the next phase of defeating the Sentinel to startSentinel Multiball; for instance, if the Sentinel has spawned but its mouth isn\u2019t open yet, making a Fastball Special will instantly advance to that phase.\nLight extra ball at the right inlane by:\nCompleting 3, then 7missions\nScoring the firstlevel 3 Beast\u2019s Lab award\nShoot the X-Mansion target (located above the Gambit pop) 4 times to light the right outlane ball save and make progress towards qualifying Jean Grey for use inthe future.\nThe X-Mansion ball save cannot be advanced or qualified in the future unless Jean Grey has been qualified with enough shots to the target that lights the outlane ball save.\nBonus can be held by hitting the \u201cbonus hold\u201d target directly below the danger room\u2019s mini-flipper, though it cannot be hit intentionally. If bonus is held on the last ball, it will instead be doubled.\nWikified.\nLooking forward to playing this, seems like some really interesting geometry.  Nice job@DEADFLIP\nThe Danger Room is like gold wings\nIthinkI figured out the whole point of lighting/qualifying Cerebro: it appears if you hold down the action button during modes (should be flashing red) you get a strobing blue shot.  Hitting this will win the mode (or at least that\u2019s what happened the two times I hit it).\nBishop, not Cerebro.\nA few things I noticed in 0.84\n(All 8 missions are now available at game start, with the ones on the corners being the easier ones, and the ones on the edges marked \u201cchallenging\u201d.)\nBishop: When the action button is red, hold it down during a mode to cycle through shots. Sometimes he\u2019ll say \u201clet me know what I\u2019m shooting at!\u201d Release the button when the desired shot is lit to claim that award.\nSentinel Raid: Sentinel inserts will repeatedly cycle from right to left. Hit a shot while it\u2019s lit for advancing points and to advance through the mode.\nFuture: If the action button is blinking blue, you\u2019ll stay in the future to battle sentinels. If it\u2019s solid blue, the next Cerebro shot will return you to the past. Press the action button to alternate.\nSo you no longer are presented with only the four corner modes first, And then access to the additional 4 edge (N-S-E-W) modes available only after your first Future mini-mode play?\nAll 8 are now offered immediately?\nYes, that\u2019s correct. You have the option of playing all 8, right out the gate.\nhuh, that\u2019s too bad.  I was digging the concept of needing to unlock the more lucrative edge modes.\nany idea what the danger room level benefit is? 2x? 3x?\nYeah I did like not having all the modes being available on start also. If I would like it if the modes being all unlocked on start, then doing the \u201cTier 2\u201d modes on start would be at reduced scoring. Once you go to the future, the original scoring for the \u201cTier 2\u201d modes would be unlocked. This is like playing Godzilla and having the Tier 2 modes being unlocked before you do any of the Tier 1 modes.\nHi, i made some changes last night based on what I saw on stream at pinball expo. I\u2019m wondering if they have some sort of advanced code on that though because it has a new \u201cquickshot\u201d called fastball special and had some updated screens/visuals. (For instance, the mode screen shows mode progress: either \u201cmode complete\u201d or a progress bar like the beast lab if you drained or timed out your last mode).\nI\u2019ll be at my local arcade this evening to see if there were any updates since i last played on 10/16, but 0.84 was released on 10/07 so I\u2019m pretty sure my local pin was on the latest public revision. Are there differences between pro/prem/LE codes?\n0.85 was at expoStill not on the stern website\nIt looks like Danger room level up conditions may be randomized between games on 0.87? I had some games iirc which were 30/2/2/2, 25/2/1/4, 25/4/2/2? Maybe i\u2019m just dreaming? I wonder if the skillshot spots some number of these conditions? I\u2019ll need to pay closer attention next time I play.\nYou were not dreaming. I saw a \u201c25/\u2026\u201d at least once yesterday.\nBug report:I had a well-played Save the City MB at Danger Room Level 3.  At the end of the game, I got to enter initials for the best Save the City MB to date:xmen21920\u00d71441 255 KB\nBut my final score was only 180M:xmen11920\u00d71441 327 KB\nI don\u2019t know if this is just a display error, or if it\u2019s miscalculating the MB total, or if the MB is not awarding to my final score properly, but something\u2019s not adding up.  The game was on location, so I\u2019ll have to leave it for Stern to figure out how this is possible.\nI think I found a bug on the latest build. If Fastball Special and Save The City are both lit, and you don\u2019t choose the Fastball shot up the left ramp and instead choose the tight loop around the left side of the Sentinal head to right return lane to start Save The City, the machine freezes. It won\u2019t start a ball recovery mode for a few minutes, either. I sat there waiting for it for what seemed like a full 90 - 120 seconds and nothing happened. I turned around to get the machine key to put the ball back in the launch lane, but it finally just released the trap post and drained the ball while I was away.\nAnyone else experience this?\ndid it freeze up like how at times other stern games stack up videos in an delayed way?\nLong time follower, first time caller. Nearly certain the same situation happened to me. Eventually the post dropped and I think carried on like nothing happened after, but it took about two minutes and there was no ball search\nHad this situation happen last night. Shot to the left of the sentinel head was lit yellow and my fast ball special started. I had never seen a yellow arrow there before so I chose to shoot it and the post came up and caught it and the screen showed a map of cities or something like that and then just did nothing for 2 minutes. No ball searching or anything. Then it tosses out a multiball where I felt like nothing looked lit but one shot was white? My total in it was 6 mil.\nOn previous code I had a glitch where I ripped some shot and then it said save the city multiball and the achievement popped up for starting it and then the ball immediately right outlane drained and it didn\u2019t give me the multiball. Total 00.\nIs this multiball supposed to be in the game yet? Is it playable. i have limited time on it."

Hitting the lit roll overs are worth 150k each for the first successful skill shot to the lit lane, 50K+ each for subsequent successful skill shots to the lit lane.  If you don\u2019t hit the lit lane on the first ball, it stays 250K plus possible 150K for each rollover for max of 550K.  Missing rollovers has no effect on future skill shots, only making the lit lane which completes the skill shot.1st skill shot:  250k base + 150/150 rollover, max 550k2nd skill shot: 750k base + 200/200 rollover, max 1,150k3rd skill shot: 1,250k base + 250/250 rollover, max 1,750k4th skill shot: 1,750k base + 300/300 rollover, max 2,350k\nStacking MBsThe only multiballs that can be stacked are Blood Bath and Prison or Blood Bath and Well Walker. Prison and Well can not be started at the same time. The order in which the multiballs are started does not matter. You can not advance progress towards Prison while Well is running and vice versa. Modes started before multiball continue to run during multiball. If a mode times out during multiball, additional modes can be started by clearing the drop target bank multiple times. (Though not on Competition Settings.)\nPrison Multiball is started at the center prison feature by bashing the closed doors until PRISON is spelled and then \u2018clearing the prison yard\u2019. By default, the first few letters of PRISON are spotted for you. Completing PRISON will engage the magnet, expose the zombie head behind the doors, and light shots around the playfield for clearing the yard. Each major shot can be made once to advance PRISON letters again, while shots to the exposed zombie head behind the prison doors clears a shot and letter. Ultimately, spelling PRISON again lights the zombie head for one more hit to start Prison Multiball.\nPrison Multiball is a 3 ball multiball. By default there is a medium length ball save period and no add a ball in Prison Multiball. From Prison Multiball, only Blood Bath multiball can be stacked.\nDuring Prison Multiball, hitting the closed doors or a major shot opens the doors to expose the zombie head. Hitting the zombie head closes the doors and relights shots. Rinse and repeat for various jackpots (usually somewhere around 1 million). During the multiball, the value of the prison yard walkers increases each time a prison yard walker is killed while the multiball is running. Each time a jackpot is scored one of the PRISON inserts will light solid, and advance 1 closer to Siege. Once six jackpots are collected the Riot shot will become lit for super jackpot which will begin phase two of Prison multiball.\nDuring phase two the left and right ramps are lit for 500k and either ramp will award 500k and add 50k to the next left or right ramp shot. The value of each ramp shot is also added to a jackpot that is collected by shooting the Prison. This jackpot also counts as a walker kill and advances 1 closer to Siege. Six of these collects in phase 2 will bring the total to 12 during Prison Multiball and light Siege. Progress in phase 1 and phase 2 carries over from one Prison Multiball to the next.\nStarting MB:Basically, you need to hit the Well Walker 10 times to start Well Walker MB.\nMore specifically, spell W-E-L-L, then hit Well Walker when the WELL inserts are flashing (25K per shot). Then 5 more shots while the WELL inserts are strobing from left to right or right to left, at this stage the remaining number of shots will be visible on the DMD. Each of these shots can be worth between 55K and 75K, depending on how many inserts are lit when you hit the Well Walker.\nDuring MB:During phase one of Well Walker multiball, each letter is relit by hitting a certain number of switches.  W: 25, E: 30, L: 35, L: 40 (although the previous jackpot also counts so it\u2019s really 29, 34, 39).  The well walker jackpot continues to build for every switch hit.  Hitting the walker scores and adds to the bonus the total value collected in the starting phase based on the values of the WELL when hit, e.g. 50k no letters lit, 55k one letter lit up to 75k if all letters were lit.  Normally somewhere around 300-350k.  Once a letter is completed with the switch hits, the well walker jackpot is lit and hitting the walker collects the current jackpot value and then resets it to zero.  Completing all WELL lights and jackpots then lights the Super Jackpot that re-collects all of the jackpots by hitting the walker again.  Good time to use a big multiplier.  Note:  the premium/LE use of the spinner is valuable in this phase compared to the pro.  Multi-kill is started once the jackpot is collected for the first L (thus the third jackpot, W-E-L).\nOnce the super jackpot is collected, phase two begins and continues until multiball ends.  During phase two the left and right ramp are lit for 500k and either ramp will award 500k and add 50k to the next left or right ramp shot. The value of each ramp shot is also added to a jackpot that is collected by shooting the Well Walker.  Once a jackpot is collected, the jackpot resets to zero until more ramps are hit.  The jackpot and ramps can continue to be hit and will raise by 50K each hit until multi-ball ends.  Raising jackpots and then collecting via walker with a multiplier can lead to huge jackpots.\nBlood Bath multiball is qualified by collecting a full set of supply inserts shown in front of the drop target bank. In single ball play the supply inserts will light in sequence from First aid to Weapons and finally to Food. Whenever any of the drop targets are hit the currently lit supply will be locked in. Once all drops have been completed the lit supply will remain solid to indicate that supply has been collected. Once all supplies have been collected the Blood Bath insert will strobe. Clearing the bank once more will begin blood bath multiball. Blood Bath multiball can be started during prison or well walker multiball.\nBlood Bath Multiball is a two ball multiball with a long ball save where each switch is worth 15K points initially. Any time the drop target bank is cleared the value of each switch is increased by 2.5K points. Each switch hits\u2019 score is added to the blood bath jackpot value, which is collected whenever the drop target bank is cleared. Super jackpots are awarded when all of the supplies are collected during blood bath. Blood bath is the only main multiball that has an add-a-ball. There are two add-a-balls available by clearing the drop target bank. However, an unlimited number of add-a-balls is awarded by achieving a super jackpot during Blood Bath Multiball.\nGathering a full set of supplies progresses towards Blood Bath Multiball. Each individual supply also awards the following:\nFIRST AID\nCompleting the drop targets when \u201cFIRST AID\u201d is lit will permanently increase the value of the prison yard walkers for the remainder of the game.\nCompleting the drop targets when \u201cFIRST AID\u201d is lit will permanently increase the value of the prison yard walkers for the remainder of the game.\nPrem/LE only: Awards a \u201cPrison Bomb\u201d if Prison doors are open. Bombs can be used to advance 1 hit towards Prison Multiball or collect a jackpot in Prison Multiball.\nPrem/LE only: Awards a \u201cPrison Bomb\u201d if Prison doors are open. Bombs can be used to advance 1 hit towards Prison Multiball or collect a jackpot in Prison Multiball.\nWEAPONS\nLights the Arena ramp for Crossbow Mode.\nPrem/LE only: Awards a \u201cHorde Bomb\u201d which can be used to kill a walker in Horde.\nFOOD\nIncreases a shot multiplier for the well.  The multiplier is awarded for any hit to the well, then reset.\nPrem/LE only: Awards a \u201cWell Walker Bomb\u201d if Well Walker has been activated (DMD animation shows # of hits left). Bombs can be used to advance 1 hit towards Well Multiball or collect a jackpot in Well Multiball.\nDead Features are the main modes ofThe Walking Dead. Qualify them by completing the drop target bank enough times (1 completion for the first mode, then 2 completions for further modes; unique Suppliesdon\u2019tneed to be collected).\nWhen qualified, inserts corresponding to unplayed Dead Features pulse; when played, they stay solid. Making the respective shot starts the mode. If the player drains while Dead Features are qualified, but not started, only one drop target completion is required to re-light them.\nDuring any Dead Feature, making a shot that corresponds to a previously-played mode (i.e. has a solidly-lit mode insert) scores points and builds the values of the current Dead Feature. Completing the drop target bank adds 10 seconds to the timer. Making enough shots in a Dead Feature will start a Multi-Kill.\nThe Dead Features are:\nBarn: Started at the left orbit. Shoot the left orbit repeatedly to kill walkers in the barn. Awards start at 2.5M and increase by 500K per shot. A Multi-Kill is awarded after 3 left orbit shots.\nCDC: Started at the left ramp. Each left ramp shot adds a red arrow on the playfield, from left to right and excluding the left ramp itself, and adds 750K + 25K per left ramp shot to the red arrow value. Shooting a red arrow unlights it, scores the award value, and qualifies the left ramp for two shots to finish the mode; the first shot is worth the award value, and the second shot is worth the total value of all red arrows made. A Multi-Kill is awarded after 3 left ramp shots.\nRiot: Started at the Riot shot. Shoot the Riot shot to kill riot gear walkers and collect the Riot value, which starts at 1-3M (what is this based on?) and increases by 75K per switch hit. This can be collected repeatedly. A Multi-Kill is awarded after 2 Riot shots.\nTunnel: Started at the Railroad (Tunnel) shot. All shots light for 5M. Hitting the Tunnel before making any other lit shot increases all award values by 2.5M. Making any non-Tunnel shot locks in the award value and lights the Tunnel shot to complete the mode. Completing all non-Tunnel shots without hitting the Tunnel relights them and adds 2.5M to each one. A Multi-Kill is awarded after 2 lit shots are made.\nArena: Started at the right ramp. Repeatedly shoot the right ramp to score increasing values starting at a base value of 3M and increasing by 3x, 6x, 9x, etc. If the right ramp is shot out of a repeated combo, the value will be halved. For example, making 2 straight shots and shooting the 3rd ramp later (aka \u201cout of combo\u201d) will award 3M, 4M, and then 2.5M. After any right ramp shot, the Woodbury shot will briefly light to end the mode and collect roughly 20% of the total number of points earned by shooting the ramp. A Multi-Kill is awarded after 3 right shots are made.\nPlay all 5 Dead Features to qualify Escape Terminus (see Mini-Wizard modes). Once Escape Terminus has been played, all Dead Features reset and can be started again.\nShooting the stab targets (targets to either side of the Prison barn) lights 2X playfield. Shooting the Tower standup above the top rollovers starts 2x playfield scoring for 20 seconds. Completing the stab targets repeated times before starting 2X increases its time.\nAchieving 5 zombie kills on default settings lights Bicycle Girl on the CDC ramp. After shooting the CDC ramp, the Bicycle girl light will light on the Pro, or the Left Ramp will raise to reveal a target on the Prem/LE. Loop the CDC ramp or hit the under-ramp target for points shown on the DMD which decrease in value if not made. Bicycle girl is completed by making three CDC ramp shots. 20 kills are needed for successive modes.\n1 Multi-Kill is awarded by shooting 3 Bicycle Girl Hurry up shots.\nCompleting the top lanes adds Bonus X up to 250X and increases the value of Bit. The DMD will show an animation of walkers trying to break through a door with the words Dead Inside written on the door. A number is also displayed which I believe is 40 and increases for subsequent pop jackpots. The yellow rail road insert will strobe when the pops jackpot is available. The value of the jackpot is increased by each pop bumper hit. You can collect the pops jackpot by shooting the Tunnel shot. Unlike the Tunnel mode shot only the first switch above the pops needs to be hit in order to score the jackpot.\nHit the Woodbury drop target to light super spinner at Barn and Woodbury. Build the Flamethrower jackpot by ripping the spinner, and collect it by shooting Woodbury.\nEvery 2 Walker kills lights the \u201cX\u201d above an inlane. This begins a 2X shot multiplier for the next shot hit after rolling over the X. You can control whether or not you take the shot multiplier by using the flipper buttons to control which outlane is lit. This multiplier advances by 1 every second walker you kill without collecting it. So if you kill 4 walkers without using the shot multiplier, it will be 3X. Two more and it will be 4X. This multiplier will apply to the next shot you hit. There is no apparent ceiling for multipliers.\nDraining out a lit outlane collects the Bit value. This starts at 500K and increases by 250K with each completion of the top lanes.\nShooting the right ramp three times awards 100,000 from Fish Tank and lights Woodbury.\nCrossbow is lit at the right ramp after the weapons supply insert is collected. The five mode shots are lit for 1M+. Certain switches will disqualify crossbow if a shot is missed. If you are shooting the Tunnel crossbow shot and accidentally hit the well walker the crossbow mode ends. If you are shooting the Riot crossbow shot and hit a stab stand up, the mode ends. During a multiball, no other target hits will disable the Crossbow. Multiple crossbow \u201cattempts\u201d can be stacked at once. If you have collected the weapons supply insert multiple times and shoot the right ramp to light crossbow then shoot the right ramp to collect crossbow the next crossbow mode will start immediately after the right ramp is collected.\nOn the Premium and LE, the ball will cradle in a shooting arm (similar to Austin Powers), and the button can be used to fire the ball at one of the shots.\nHitting three lit crossbow shots during the crossbow mode will start Crossbow Frenzy. This is a timed mode in which every right ramp loads the Crossbow to shoot at lit shots.Scoring is based on the values you scored in crossbow shots previously before starting Frenzy. Your first crossbow frenzy shot is the same value as your first crossbow award. BUT things get interesting as your next frenzy shot is the value of your second crossbow shot made previously PLUS the value of the last crossbow FRENZY shot. It\u2019s like Fibonacci progression\u2026 if you scored 1 mil, 2 mil, 3 mil, 4 mil, 5 mil on your crossbows then your crossbow frenzy shots would be:1 mil1 mil + 2 mil ( 3 mil )(3 mil) + 3 mil (6 mil)(6 mil) + 4 mil (10 mil)(10 mil) + 5 mil (15 mil for you last shot!)\nThis can be compounded with multipliers of course, but NOT compunded in the sense of the fibonacci part of the next shot adding to previous\u2019 shot value. So if your first crossbow shot during normal play had an inlane X, that full multiplied value is used as the base value for crossbow frenzy shot 1, which can then of course be multiplied again. However, only the value you had at the start of frenzy gets added in to the next award.\nMulti-Kill is qualified by completing or making a minimum number of shots during modes, multiballs and other game features. Once qualified a yellow insert will light at one of the five mode shots. Shooting each shot awards2 Walkersand 1/20th your total mode points. To collect the Multi-Kill value shoot the lit shot. Multi-Kill stays active until your current ball is drained. Multi-Kill can be lit on the next ball in the same way and the value is not reset between balls. When a Multi-Kill is qualified, one of the Multi-Kill inserts will become lit. Once all inserts are lit, Horde mode is qualified and started at the Woodbury/Extra Ball shot. Multi-Kills are not active during Horde.\nThere are 14 game objectives that qualify Multi-Kills as of v. 1.60:\nAfter all of the Multi-Kill inserts have been lit the Horde insert will strobe as well as the dome flasher above the Woodbury/Extra Ball shot. Shooting Woodbury will begin Horde. Horde begins as a two ball multiball and all mode shots are lit for jackpots. These shots represent walkers that are advancing towards the player. Initially the red arrows are lit and as a walker advances towards the player the remaining inserts will light to indicate how close a walker is. The inserts light from the red arrow to the cross hair insert. The DMD also reflects how close a walker is as they advance.\nThe first \u201cwave\u201d of Horde requires 3 kills. Once all the required kills have been made, a DMD animation showing a bomb dropping occurs, which clears all walkers, awards a Super Jackpot, and an add-a-ball. Subsequent waves require one added kill before awarding another Super Jackpot and add-a-ball. Each subsequent Super Jackpot is roughly 2M more than the previous, to no known limit.\nThere are 4 distances before a walker reaches you, and shooting a walker awards a jackpot multiplied by up to 4x depending on how close the walker is. In addition, the playfield lights under each shot will light up as a walker approaches; the number of lights lit indicates the multiplier. A walker bomb also awards a larger number of points than individual shots.\nAlso during the mode, an \u201cescape value\u201d jackpot will accumulate. When only one ball remains, if a certain number of \u201cwaves\u201d have been completed (default: 3), Woodbury will be lit to escape from the Horde. The DMD will present two options: FIGHT or ESCAPE. If FIGHT is selected, Horde continues as usual. If ESCAPE is selected, the \u201cescape value\u201d jackpot is awarded and Horde ends safely. If the ball is plunged without selecting an option with the flippers, the game assumes you chose to FIGHT.\nIf a walker reaches the player, power is killed to the flippers and Horde ends. In regular (non-competition) play, this will not end your ball, but it WILL end your ball in competition mode.\nStart Siege when lit by shooting the prison. 12 Jackpots at the Prison shot are required during Prison multiball in order to qualify Siege (see Prison Multiball above). The mode begins with Barn, Prison and Arena lit for jackpots. Shooting the prison or either lit shot will progress to the next round. In the second phase of Siege all five mode shots and the prison are lit for jackpots. Shooting the prison or any lit shot will award jackpots. Once all available jackpots have been scored, all shots relight. Shooting any of the lit shots or prison will end the mode. The mode does carry on from ball to ball, so you can drain and continue. This mode seems unfinished as of v1.28.\nEscape Terminus is the sixth Dead Feature, which is qualified by playing all five Dead Features, and relighting them afterwards via the drops. Shoot any major Dead Feature shot to begin (they will all be flashing in unison). All five Dead Feature shots are lit for a hurry-up. Shooting a lit shot collects the hurry-up, unlights the shot, and starts a new one. Collect all five hurry-ups to finish. The initial hurry-up values are dependent on your mode scores as follows:\n20% of your 5th mode score.\n20% of your (5th+4th) mode score.\n20% of your (5th+4th+3rd) mode score.\n20% of your (5th+4th+3rd+2nd) mode score.\n20% of all your combined mode scores.\nTo score well in this round, it is imperative that you attempt to play out your modes - especially your later ones. All Dead Features will reset and can be played again after this mode.\n(basing this off observations from Keith\u2019s videos)Kill all 115 walkers to light Last Man Standing at the Woodbury shot. It may be started while a mode is running. Last Man Standing is a four-ball multiball where you must kill 115 walkers yet again. This time, the walker count lights will countdownfrom 115, signifying how many more are remaining. The value of each walker killed seems to gradually ramp up as the mode continues. The number of lights for each shot indicates how many walkers will be killed - some shots will kill one, some two, and some up to three. Also, the most recent shot made will be unlit until another shot is made (leaving that one unlit until the next, and so on). Add-a-balls are available at certain checkpoints throughout the mode, based on number of walkers killed. A line at the bottom of the LMS DMD animation tells how many more needed to light add-a-ball if it is not currently lit.\nLast Man Standing does not end when the player is down to a single ball. Killing all 115 walkers will immediately turn everything off, award a 100M completion bonus, and a very cool ending sequence.\nIf TWD is set to Competition Install, then the following noteworthy items are changed:\nModes cannot belitduring a multiball or as part of the drops completion that begins Bloodbath MB.\nYour accumulated Multi-Kill value doesnotreset once you\u2019ve played the Horde mini-wizard mode.\nExtra Ball awards points.\nIf Horde ends by getting \u201cbit\u201d by a walker reaching the player, your ball WILL end. The only way to exit Horde is to successfully escape when given the opportunity. Also, the walkers will continue to advance while deliberating between your options.\nI think the skill shot is worth 400-600K, plus the value of the previous skill shot is added to that. So, if you had 1.1M on the skill shot on ball 2, rolling over the lit rollover on ball 3 will be 1.1M+400k to 600k. I\u2019m playing on a machine with extra balls turned off so I can\u2019t confirm what happens on the extra ball.\nThis post is a wiki, so you should be able to edit it if you want. Feel free to add whatever information you have!\nthat\u2019s cool. I want to say that the rollovers add either 50k or 100k each to the base value (400k?). Also, I\u2019m unsure how the failed skill shot top lane, which I\u2019ve seen worth 250k, affects the next ball\u2019s skill shot.\nI\u2019m hoping these rule sheets can continue to grow as people figure things out about the game. Thanks for adding to it!\ni tried editing this and it didnt save \u2026 does it need approval before it goes live?\nI assume this is pro version 1.19. On the  LE Prison is 3 ball multiball.\nhey yeah, I put placeholders for Fish Tank and Crossbow earlier and it didn\u2019t save. I\u2019d think that since it\u2019s a wiki that code version numbers shouldn\u2019t matter as it should reflect the latest version. [test edit]\nHmmm that\u2019s weird, I will see if I can figure out what is wrong.\n@bdolsyou had been able to edit it before right?\nyes. 54321\n@bdols@ezeltmanncan you both try again? I made some adjustments.\nI\u2019m getting a 403 Forbidden for \u201cPUTWalking Dead wiki rulesheet\u201d\nCan you post a screen shot of what you\u2019re getting? I\u2019m going to take it over to the support site for the forum software. Thanks!\nIt appears we have fixed the problem if you want to try editing again.\nWas trying to figure out the shot multiplier the other night.  Is it \u201cshoot any shot with a crosshairs insert lit, to light the inlane shot multiplier\u201d?\nAlso - what do the yellow light insterts in front of the shots mean?\nHow do you get the weapon inserts at the bottom of the pf lit?\nLast I knew it was every 2 kills lights the x (or advances the multiplier).\nWas trying to figure out the shot multiplier the other night.

Feeds to top of playfield, CORE Rollovers, and right orbit.\nLeft Spinner- Spinner directly inside Left Orbit Entrance\nCORE Rollovers- At top of orbit is four rollovers labeled C, O, R, E.  The orbit has two controlled gates on either side of the rollovers.  The rollovers feed to the Reactor playfield area\nReactor Core- Playfield area at the top half of the game that is entered through the Rollovers and the ball exits at bottom of area near the scoop.  The Reactor area has elements on all sides.  The bottom is a mini flipper, with the exit directly to the right of it.  The left edge above the flipper is a rubber ring, and the panel above it is a rubber ring with kicker (like a slingshot).  The top is the CORE rollovers.  To the right are three stationary targets labeled 1, 2, 3.  Continuing around, the last side is a rubber ring with kicker.\nRight Orbit- Orbit entrance on right side of playfield.  Feeds to top of playfield, CORE Rollovers, and Left orbit.\nLower PlayfieldLower playfield is your classic Italian flipper setup with 2 standard flippers, two triangle slingshots, and one inlane and one outlane per side.Inlanes/Outlanes- Each lane is labeled labeled S, A, V, and E from left to right.  Lit inserts can be moved with each flipper button.  Used to qualify and collect ball saves.RAD Targets- Three white stationary targets directly above the left inlane area.  Each with a matching triangle insert, labeled R, A, D.  Used to qualify mystery award and destroy reactors.Destroy Targets- Red square stationary targets at left and right corners of the lower playfield area.  Inserts say DESTROY.  Used to destroy reactors.Scoop- Main Scoop on Playfield.  Can be shot from either flipper.  Is the shot for Collect Mystery and Start Reactor.  Watch out for how quick the scoop fires the ball back!Grid- Three yellow stationary targets at top center of lower playfield.  In front of the targets is a 3 x 3 grid of circular inserts.  The inserts are lit by hitting the corresponding target above each column.  Used to qualify a reactor and for reactor jackpotsLock Targets and Lock Scoop- The set of 3 in-line drop targets.  Behind the 3rd targets is a scoop.Pop Bumper- Single pop bumber along the right side of the playfield, about halfway between the right orbit entrance and the right inlane\nTotal Nuclear Annihilation (TNA) is a perfect example of \u201cSimple to learn, difficult to master\u201d.  The game play is deceptivly simple, but is loaded with behaviors aimed to press the competitiveness of the game in a head-to-head scenario.  Timing, pressure, and reaction are the reoccurring themes in TNA.\nHands-Free SkillshotAt the start of a ball, one of the CORE rollovers will be lit. The lit letter can be moved with the flippers PRIOR to plunging the ball; once the shooter lane switch opens, the selected letter is locked in.  Landing the plunged ball into the lit CORE rollover will score the \u2018Hands-Free\u2019 Skill Shot.  If you move the selected lane with the flippers AFTER the ball is plunged, you will be downgraded to the regular skillshot.\nMaking a Hands-Free skill shot will complete the Reactor grid, spot a full lane ball-save level, and award 100000 points.  If the reactor is already running, the player will get a Reactor Jackpot.\nRegular SkillshotUsing the flippers AFTER the plunge will move the lit rollover and change it\u2019s color to yellow.  Doing so will disqualify the Hands-Free Shot, and making the lit rollover will score a regular Skill Shot.\nMaking a regular skill shot will spot a whole lane ball-save level and award 50000 points.\nSecret Skill ShotWith less than 2 balls locked, full-plunge the ball passed the rollovers then flip the ball into the lock lane. 100000 are awarded and the ball is locked.\nCompetitive Notes:The controlled gates will both be OPEN on a skill shot making it more difficult to drop into the rollovers.  If you short plunge and the ball returns to the plunger, the game will QUICKLY plunge the ball and mock you.  Using a short plunge to the right orbit and right flipper can be useful if you intend to hit the Lock lane.\nEnd of ball bonus is reflected by the grid of inserts above the flippers.  Bonus is increased by\nhitting grid targets\nhitting drop targets\nBonus advance multiplied by playfield multiplier (?)\nDifferent colors in the bonus insert grid simply indicate that you\u2019re over 10k. At 11k bonus, the 10k insert will light white and the 1k insert will light in a different color. At 20k, the 1s digits will light a new color (etc.).\nBonus Multiplier- Completing the CORE rollovers will increase the end-of-ball bonus multiplier.  Multiplier will be reflected by the 2x, 3x,4x inserts below the grid.\nMystery Award is qualified by completing the RAD Targets.  Mystery is awarded by shooting the scoop.  Mystery awards include:\n+1 Tilt Warning\n10,000 Points\n25,000 Points\n150,000 Points\nComplete Keypad Grid\nEnable Ballsaver (default # of seconds)\nEnable Locks\nIncrease Lane Save Level\nEnable Super Spinner (only if not already enabled)\n+1x Bonus Multipler\nMax Out Bonus Multiplier (7x)\nSpecial note:if you are out of tilt warnings, the mystery will always award +1 Tilt Warning.\nSpinner advances Reactor Bonus.  The spinner will have its inserts lit and cycling when the Reactor is started, and will advance the Reactor\u2019s critical state.  Super Spinner can also be started (Unknown impact and qualification)\nThere is a segment display below the flippers that will count down a ball save timer.  Ball save is active at ball start.  Ball save can also be collected and activated via the rollovers in the inlanes and outlanes.  The ball passing over an unlit lane will light it red.  Both flippers can be used to cycle the lit lanes.  Lighting three S, A, V, E letters qualifies a ball save, and the 4th lane will start flashing.  Having the ball trigger a lane with the flashing insert will activate a 10 second ball save timer. If the ball hits the trough during this 10 seconds, a new ball is plunged into play and the timer is shut off.\nAdditional ball save levels can be stacked.  Stacking is indicated by color in this order: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple. There is a bonus of 10K per un-used ball save at the end of the ball.\nThe main feature and objective during the game is to destroy reactors.  The game has 9 reactors as indicated by the 1-9 numbered inserts in the middle of the lower playfield.  The game starts at Reactor 1, and destroying it, enables Reactor 2, and so on.  To destroy a reactor three phases must be completed1 - Qualify the Reactor and Start it2 - Advance the Reactor to Critical Status (100% on upper playfield numeric display)3 - Destroy the reactor by hitting the randomly lit shots\nEach Reactor has a starting bonus value, increasing with each reactor level.  Each Reactor level is more difficult by increasing the amount the reactor must be advanced, and how many targets are needed to destroy the critical reactor.\nReactor State carries over ball to ball.\nQualifying the reactorThe keypad grid located at the center of the playfield is used to qualify the reactor. The initial configuration of pink/blue lights is random. Hitting a target advances the pink light in that column upwards (pushing out the blue light above it). Filling the grid to all pink qualifies the Reactor Start at the scoop.  Shooting the scoop will start the reactor.\nOverheat the reactorOnce a reactor is started, the Segment display in the upper playfield will count up to 99 as the player advances the Reactor\u2019s status.  The Reactor is advanced by hitting the spinners and all switches/slingshots in the reactor area of the playfield (the upper playfield area).  The kicker sides of the reactor advance the status quicker than the other sides.  Advancing the reactor status will also advance the Reactor Value.  Once the Reactor status surpasses 99, the Reactor is at critical and is ready to be destroyed.\nMax reactor value depends on the reactor level. Reactor 1 maxes at 75,000, reactor 2 at 112,500, reactor 3 at 150,000 etc. The Reactor Value can be increased at any time before destroying it. The fastest way to increase the value is hitting the 1,2,3 targets (in order) in the reactor area, but other switches in the area will increase the value as well. Once the lit 3 target is hit, the value is maxed and cannot be increased further.\nFor the first two reactors, both orbits will be lit pink, indicating that they will both feed the lanes into the reactor area. For subsequent reactors, only one orbit will be lit. This toggles with sling and pop bumper hits.\nDestroy the ReactorOnce critical, one or more targets on the lower playfield will have their inserts lit white and flashing.  To destroy reactor 1, only one target is lit, higher reactors require hitting more targets.  The targets to hit will be randomly picked from the RAD, Destroy, and Pop Bumper.  (the Pop Bumber can represent two targets).  Hitting all the flashing targets will collect the current Reactor Bonus and reset the Grid for the next reactor.\nReactor JackpotOnce a reactor has been started, the Grid resets and can be completed the same as qualifying the reactor.  But instead of green, hits will fill the grid with red.  Completing the grid will collect a Reactor Jackpot which awards a point value 25% of the current Reactor Value.\nMultiball is qualifed by locking two balls and then releasing the balls by hitting the Lock Target after two balls are locked.  Multiball is a 3 ball multiball.  Progress towards qualifying, completing, and collecting reactors is possible during multiball.\nBall LockBall locks are collected in the in-line Lock lane.  Lock will be lit at the start of each ball and the lock arrows will be lit green.  Two balls can be locked by shooting the in-line target lane, and the drop targets will reset to trap a ball behind the first two targets.  Hitting the Lock target after two balls are locked will start multiball.\nLock Re-LightAfter a multiball completes, the drop targets will maintain their current up/down states. Lock inserts will be blue, and you must work your way back to the scoop behind them to relight the standard lock sequence.\nCompetitive Note:  Ball Lock stealing is possible and encouraged.  Players get credit for whatever balls are already in the lock when they start their turn.  Backhanding the lock lane is possible, but gets more dangerous the deeper the drop targets are down.\nJackpotsAt the start of multiball, all three Lock Targets will be up.  Jackpots are hitting the Lock Drop Targets.  1st Target = 1x Jackpot, 2nd Target = 2x Jackpot, 3rd Target = 3x Jackpot, scoop = Super Jackpot (5x Jackpot).  The drop targets will cascade back on you every 5 seconds if you do not achieve the next jackpot.  Example:  You\u2019ve made the 2x jackpot, but do not collect the 3x in time, the targets will reset so only the 1x jackpot is ready.\nCompetitive Notes:It is possible to score a quick Super Jackpot when multiball starts by shooting the lock scoop before the targets reset.\nMultiball MultiplierDuring multiball, playfield values will be multiplied by the number of balls in play.  The muliplier inserts will change color and reflect the playfield multiplier during multiball (2x or 3x).\nAdd-a-ballDuring multiball, put the ball in the scoop behind the drop targets for an add-a-ball. This can raise the playfield multiplier to 4x if you still have all other balls in play. Add-a-ball will be awarded if you hit that scoop immediately when the multiball starts, before the drops have been reset to the up position.\nJackpot valuesFormula:[seed value] x [reactor scaler] x [multiball multiplier] x [jackpot multiplier]\nInitial jackpot seed is 5000   (boosts?)Reactor Scaler is multiplier that changes based on which reactor is active (values?  Ex: second reactor is 1.5)Multiball Multiplier = Number of balls in playJackpot Multiplier = 1x, 2x, 3x, or 5x\nCompetitive Notes:  The reactor grid is very dangerous to shoot, so being able to qualify the grid with multiball chaos is very attractive.  The playfield multiplier is also very attractive to have active before destroying a reactor as the reactor values are the biggest points in the game.\nDestroy all 9 reactors.  Destroying all reactors completes the game and game will terminate.  Similar to \u2018beating\u2019 a video/arcade game. If there are balls remaining, message on screen says, \u201cFlippers and slings disabled\u201d and when ball drains, player will be credited with Total Nuclear Annihilation Bonus again.\nWki\u2019d.\nSo, do I need to be a member for longer or have a specific number of posts to contribute to a Wiki?

It seems that these are what determine whether the ball will go around the orbit or be stopped at the upper lanes\u2026right?  It makes a big difference when trying to overheat the reactors.\nOne side or the other is lit, alternating by bumpers and slings. Inlane immediately lights the correct side. For the first 2 reactors, both sides are always lit."

    "World Cup Soccer": {
        "https://pinballprimer.github.io/wcs_G42E2.html": "Not to be confused with Soccer (Williams, 1964), World Cup (Williams, 1978), or World Challenge Soccer (Premier Gottlieb, 1994).Also known as World Champion Soccer in certain re-releases, such as on The Pinball Arcade.Colloquially known as \"dog soccer\" or \"doggy soccer\" due to the prevalence of Striker the World Cup Pup, the mascot of both this pinball game and the real 1994 World Cup.\nShoot the four star rollovers in front of the Goal to light it. Make goals to light Ultra features and work toward TV awards at the scoop. Shoot ramps or lanes that are lit for Build Lock to collect qualities on the soccer ball to light the lock, and start multiball at the TV saucer. Shooting both ramps or completing the top lanes (only reachable through left orbit shots) lights the left orbit for Travel: collect all 9 cities to qualify the Final Match wizard mode.\nThe Coin Toss is a flip ramp that the ball goes up, doubles back on, and falls through one of 3 holes. When flashing, the first lane scores 5,000,000, the second lane scores 10,000,000, and the third lane scores 30,000,000 points and instantly advances one City. Going through an already lit hole scores 1,000,000.\nThe Goal is lit at the start of each ball. Once collected, the Goal must be relit by rolling over all 4 buttons on the way to the goal. Buttons can also be spotted by the small Striker target behind the spinning soccer ball. Making a goal scores 10,000,000 points and increases the goal count. Every goal adds 5,000,000 to the end of ball bonus and starts one of the Ultra modes. Every 4th goal lights the TV saucer for an award. Goals are also very important in multiball as explained below.\nA small saucer just in front and to the left of the goal is the Assist saucer. It can't be shot directly and must be ricocheted into, usually off of the giant spinning soccer ball. Press the flipper while the ball is in the saucer to shoot it at the goalie. It's rather easy to time this right to score a Goal. The Assist saucer always scores a Goal if you make the shot, even if the rollover buttons aren't all lit. During multiball, this saucer will autofire balls into the goal when the game knows that the goalie is out of the way.\nEach goal lights an Ultra mode unless all 4 are currently running. Ultra modes add to the scoring of certain shots, up to the maximum of 30,000,000 points. Scoring from Ultra modes is only added to your score in bonus, so don't tilt after a ball with lots of Ultra collects! The four Ultra modes are:\nUltra Ramps: ramps worth 5,000,000 each\nUltra Spinner: spinner (left orbit) worth 1,000,000 per spin\nUltra Jets: pop bumpers (also left orbit) worth 2,000,000 per hit\nUltra Goalie: hit the goalie in front of the goal for 5,000,000 each\nScoring 30,000,000 from an ultra mode instantly ends the mode and scores 10,000,000 points.\nCities are lit by making both ramps once, or by shooting the left orbit until the top lanes at the back right of the machine are completed. Shoot the left orbit when lit for Travel to advance the city. The Striker award can also spot the next 3 cities. The first three cities are Chicago, Dallas, and Boston, and score 10,000,000 each: making Boston starts Tea Party, a 40,000,000 hurry-up collected by any hit to the left spinner. The second group of three cities is New York, Orlando, and Washington DC, which score 15,000,000 each: advancing to DC lights an extra ball at Striker's hideout in the backof the game. The third group of three cities is San Francisco, Detroit, and Los Angeles, which score 20,000,000 each: making it to LA lights the TV saucer for Final Match, the game's wizard mode.\nAny shot that is lit white for Build Lock awards one of the qualities on the soccer ball in the playfield: Stamina, Strength, Speed, Spirit, and Skill. The left orbit, both ramps, and Striker's hideout can be lit for Build Lock. After finishing the soccer ball, both ramps light for a Lock. After locking one ball, the TV saucer is lit for Final Draw, which starts multiball.\nYour Rank at the beginning of multiball is #15 by default, increasing by 1 rank for every 2 goals collected over the course of the game. #14 Russia is worth a 20,000,000 jackpot; each rank higher is worth 5,000,000 more than the previous, up until #3 Australia being worth 75,000,000, followed by #2 France at 100,000,000 and #1 Germany at 250,000,000. Shoot a Goal to score a jackpot and beat that opponent, then shoot either ramp to start the game with the next opponent.Defeating Germany starts Victory Lap. Both ramps and the goal will be lit for 50,000,000 per shot. After five of these are collected, only one of the three shots will be lit at a time, but the Laps keep the same value for the rest of the multiball.If you drain during multiball, the next multiball will start 2 ranks higher than where the previous one drained (or it will start from the Germany match if you beat Germany previously- they will be rank #2 now, since you beat them, but they still come with a 250,000,000 jackpot).\nThe TV is lit at the start of each ball, and relit by collecting 4 goals. Shooting the TV when it is lit for TV award (but not if it is lit for Final Draw or Final Match) starts the next mode. TV modes are always 20 seconds long, and always cycle in this order:\nBig Goal Round: shoot the goal 3 times to spell Big. The first two each score 15,000,000 points, and the third scores 30,000,000 points. Making all three shots in 5 seconds or less grants the opportunity for a 4th shot worth 60,000,000 that adds an ! to the word Big.\nExtra Ball Round: an extra ball is lit at Striker's hideout for 20 seconds.\nHit the Goalie: the goalie scores 10,000,000 per hit, and his value can be increased by 10,000,000 for each goal made within the time limit.\nWhere's Striker: shoot the three Striker targets (either side of the left ramp, or the single standup to the right of the Hideout sort of behind the soccer ball). The first scores 15,000,000, the second scores 20,000,000, and the third scores 25,000,000. The first two hits often include amusing easter eggs toward other Bally/Williams/Midway pinball or arcade games.\nStarting a 5th TV mode will just activate Big Goal Round again. No increase in scoring for these modes the second time through.\nStriker's Hideout is a narrow shot to a saucer just to the right of the goal. At the start of each ball, and after hitting any of the three Striker targets a total of 7 times to spell the word Striker, this saucer will be lit for a random award. Awards available from this mystery include:\n20,000,000 points\nExtra Ball\nSpot 3 Cities\n3 Goals (including starting 3 Ultra modes)\nSuper Free Kick (for 25 seconds, the Free Kick target is worth 10,000,000 for the first hit, and 5,000,000 more than the previous hit for each additional hit)\nPenalty Kick (a one-time, reflex shot toward the goal with the goalie not moving. Score the goal for 30,000,000 points)\nAfter advancing the cities all the way to Los Angeles for the World Cup Final, shoot the TV saucer to start Final Match. The Final Match is a 5-ball multiball timed to last for 45 seconds. There is unlimited ballsave during this time. The object is to score as many goals as possible within the time limit. Germany, your opponent, will score on their own every few seconds. Score more goals than Germany within the 45 seconds to win the World Cup. If the score is tied, sudden death overtime begins, which in practice means that you have about 8-10 seconds to score one more goal before Germany does. It typically takes about 5 goals to beat Germany. Whether you win or lose, this mode is worth 75,000,000 per goal scored once it ends: if you win, a 500,000,000 bonus is added to that. It's not too hard to beat Germany, and trips to this mode should always score at least 875,000,000 points unless the goalie plays out of his mind.\nScores 10,000,000 points when lit, and is lit by entering either of the two Lights Free Kick saucers in the lower playfield. Positioned just to the left of the TV saucer.\nWorld Cup Soccer has a conventional in/out lane setup. In the left out lane is a kickback called the Corner Kick that is lit when a ball goes through the right in lane and is immediately shot to hit the left standup target. The right out lane is lit for a special after advancing to Germany during Final Draw multiball. There is a magna save positioned just above the tip of a raised left flipper, activated by pressing the second button on the left side of the cabinet. The magna save can be relit by shooting a ball at the far right standup target with the magnet next to it immediately after that ball passes through the left in lane.\nBonus is equal to:\n5,000,000 points for each goal scored in the game so far, plus\n5,000,000 points for each city traveled to in the game so far, plus\nthe scores banked up from all 4 Ultra modes on the current ball only.\nIt's not uncommon for the bonus to reach several hundred million points. Take care not to tilt, especially on ball 3 or at the end of a long ball 1/2. There is no bonus multiplier at all, and there is no way to carry Ultra bonuses forward from one ball to the next.\nSpecial scores 100,000,000 points in novelty/competition play. Extra ball cannot be set to a particular point value.\nThe game can be set to give Striker awards from the unlit Goal always, only for the first Striker award, or never.The Striker extra ball can either be an instant award, or a lit extra ball requiring another shot to Striker's hideout.\nThe Goal can be lit at the start of each ball or not.Shooting a ramp can spot 0, 1, or 2 rollover buttons toward lighting the Goal.\nThe kickback can be disabled entirely, or set up such that 1, 2, or 3 kickbacks can be stored at a time.\nExtra balls and special can be set to have their own ball to ball memory, or not.\nThe magna save can be set not to light for free at the start of a game."
